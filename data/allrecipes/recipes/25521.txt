This recipe is wonderful. So flavorful, it makes a great substitute for other kinds of sandwich spreads. I mixed in feta cheese. Amazing spread. Yummy In general the recipe was great and my guests enjoyed it. I made a couple of minor changes and added some tomato paste (for more tomato flavor) and additional „italian“ spices and less garlic. I would make it again. I made this receipe but used  more olive oil to make it less like a paste.  I froze the spread to have on hand for later use.  It is delicious. This is really good. Used on chicken Panini's.  Cheaper than buying in the store. Oh, and I have frozen this and the texture is okay if using again in recipe, not for a spread though. This recipe is DELICIOUS!  So flavorful and easy to make too.  I will be making his one often!  Thanks for sharing :-) This would be good if it was called tomato and basil dip or use as a pizza sauce, or if you thinned it out, it would be a wonderful pasta sauce. But as a Sun dried tomato spread, you cannot even taste the sun dried tomato part. Dip is good yes, but I was looking for a sun dried tomato dip. I added mozzarella cheese, and heated in the microwave and turned it into a pizza dip. This was so easy & so good spread with cream cheese on toasted bread!! I hate to say this recipe was terrible because I think used as a pasta sauce it would be okay, however, it would need to be thinned down some for a sauce and more spices added. The tomato paste was way too overbearing in this spread. I definitely will not make this again unless my playing with it will turn it into a great pasta sauce.
