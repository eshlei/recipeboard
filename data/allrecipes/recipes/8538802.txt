Combine 1/2 cup sugar, gelatin, and salt in a sauce pan. Stir in milk and egg yolks. Cook and stir over low heat until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add chocolate pieces, and stir until melted. Add rum and stir until well combined. Chill until partially set, about 1 hour. Beat egg whites in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into the chocolate mixture. To make whipped cream mixture, beat cream and vanilla extract in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Layer the whipped cream and chocolate mixture into the pie shell. Swirl the top with a fork to marbelize. Chill pie in the refrigerator until firm, 1 to 2 hours.
Wasted what was left of my Kahlua because of this recipe. It literally became grossly like jello, so much so that in my attempt to break it up I realized it was a lost cause.0 stars. Iâ€™ll stick with just tempering eggs for a pudding type mixture and controlling the texture from there.
