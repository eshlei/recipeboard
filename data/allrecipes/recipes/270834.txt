Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine eggs, spinach, oats, cottage cheese, applesauce, chia seeds, and baking powder together in a smoothie blender (such as a NutriBulletÂ®); blend until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into the preheated waffle iron in batches if needed, and cook until each waffle is golden brown and the iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes.
I don't own a waffle iron but the mix works well for pancakes also. Great idea if you want a savory breakfast instead of a sweet. You have to remember that spinach adds moisture so adjust liquid to compensate. I made these exactly as written.  They were very good and filling.  I liked that they give you the option of sweet or savory.  I put peanut butter and syrup on them.  The next time I'll go savory.  I used my Vitamix and the batter came out perfectly.  This one is a keeper. Made both waffles and pancakes. Waffles turned out better.My wife suggested a touch of cinnamon to the batter. Definitely a keeper.
