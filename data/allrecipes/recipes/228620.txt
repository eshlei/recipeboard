I love this recipe. I made this along with the Texas Pulled Pork from All Recipes & it was a hit. I used a 2 lb bag of shredded cole slaw & felt it was a little dry so I added 1/2 more of the ingredients. I also used someone's suggestion & used pineapple juice instead of orange juice. It was wonderful! Awesome , favorite go-to now, Thx It was delish, next time Iâ€™ll make more wet ingredients Great slaw. It will be perfect on or with pulled pork especially Carolina pulled pork with the vinegar base. Love the orange juice. Changes the flavor profile just enough to notice it. Only change I made was too add celery seed. I used 3 bags of coleslaw (cabbage and carrots) and doubled the recipe for the sauce and it was the perfect amount. Absolutely fantastic . Made it within any changes. I used the multicolor This was my first time making coleslaw. I like a sweet coleslaw and this one had the right name and great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe! I have the recipe and found it to be perfect for about four servings. Tastes very very good. Definitely a keeper for me! Very well balanced dressing good! Easy, creamy and tasty.  The best slaw I've had!
