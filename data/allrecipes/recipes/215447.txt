Awesome Recipe! So quick and easy but since I had time I changed a few things up. I chopped fresh carrots but used frozen peas. Instead of chopped onion I used pearl onions and instead of green beans I used corn. I melted the butter and sauteed the celery, carrot, garlic and onion along with bay, thyme, sage, parsley, a tsp of tumeric for color, and the rest of the ingredients but I omitted the italian seasoning and onion powder. When I dumped in the flour I let it brown a bit before adding the milk and chicken stock. I added the thawed veggies, I just ran them under cold water and strained them. I used some pulled turkey I had frozen from thanks giving and it came out awesome!!! Thanks! I added more onion, a green and red pepper, chopped fine and saut√©ed with the onion, and leftover gravy to the white sauce!  Delicious! Made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit.   Easy to make,  remember to wait the ten minutes or it will be runny! Love this recipe.  Got it from a friend with helpful notes in the margins.  Have made it several times using leftover stuffing in place of both crusts.  Pressed the stuffing into the pie plate.  Then pressed the top on a piece of parchment and flipped it onto the top.  Need to fill a lit less when using the stuffing for the crusts. This is one of my family's favorites. It's also great with leftover chicken, or rotisserie chicken, or even low sodium canned chicken. I have been making this recipe for about 6 years and everyone lovesit! Lately I have been using leftover cooked chicken and gluten free flour and a phyllo crust for the top and it is wonderful. My husband really liked this recipe. It was very good. Mine seemed a little dry so I added a can if cream of chicken soup and a quarter cup of chicken broth. It came out great. I also baked it topless crust. Very good
