https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241708/karioka-sweet-rice-balls/
Mix rice flour, shredded coconut, and 3/4 cup coconut milk together in a bowl until dough is well mixed. Form dough into balls, about 1 tablespoon per ball. Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Fry dough balls in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and transfer balls to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour 1/2 cup coconut milk into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir brown sugar into hot coconut milk until liquid thickens, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove saucepan from heat, cool coconut coating slightly, and dip balls into coating. Cool slightly before serving.
Is delicious and really easy to make, with white rice flour get crunchy but, with sweet rice flour taste more sweet, is soft and lot easy to enjoy, both way I did love it and enjoy, especially the coconut syrup, wow, that hit the spot, thanks for sharing this recipe, I so love it and I will make it again :-) Delicious but will try it with less shredded coconut next time so it'll be closer to the original karioka back home.
