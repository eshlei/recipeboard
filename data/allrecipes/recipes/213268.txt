Classic Goulash
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/213268/classic-goulash/
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook 3 minutes, stirring often. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up the meat until it is evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 3 minutes, stirring often. Stir in water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, soy sauce, Italian seasoning, seasoned salt, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring halfway through. Stir in uncooked macaroni, cover, and simmer over medium heat until pasta is tender, 11 to 13 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, discard bay leaves, and serve.
This is the classic goulash made in the mid-west, USA, not Hungarian Goulash. I grew up on this in Iowa, but we used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, no bay leaf, and a green pepper if we had one. Used almost 4 cups of elbow mac, I think the next time I make this I'll swap the soy sauce for worcestershire sauce instead.  And a some chopped green pepper. Very good otherwise. Makes plenty. Meh....    Rather use more traditional meats next time you see. Sour cream for a topper is a must for Russians and Polish alike! Ground meat or minced meat is MEH! Love this. I make it often. I use ground turkey, it's cheaper. I think I add a lil Worcestershire and less soy. Easy and common ingredients usually in my kitchen to create a delicious family pleaser. Good as is but I added a spoon of bacon fat for extra flavor and a spoonful of Ranch Dressing. Really makes it "sing"!ü§óüëçüíñ
