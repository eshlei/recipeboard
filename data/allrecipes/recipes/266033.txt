Arrange apricots and peaches on a platter. Skewer a few grapes on a toothpick vertically and the last one horizontally (for the head). Mix confectioners' sugar with water to make a thin, slightly sticky icing. Use icing to glue 2 candy eyeballs on each piece of fruit and on the horizontal "head" of the grape caterpillar.
