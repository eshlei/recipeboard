In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg. Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated. Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
I am Southern and I can fry some chicken, but this impressed me. I usually fry with just flour, salt and pepper, but I added the spices and the egg mixture. It was good. I didn't measure anything out, just threw the spices in. I added alot more garlic, I love it, and of course more salt amd pepper. I salted and peppered the chicken and the egg mixture. You cannot fry chicken in 15 minutes. I cooked on high for 5, then flipping, on medium, with lid on for 20. Nice and crispy. Served with baked potato and corn. Will make again. Very simple to put together and not alot of ingredients! My son is a picky eater and hope that he would like it. He very much enjoyed the chicken. I cut mine up into strips. It took longer to get them all done but we'll worth it. He ate 2 chicken breasts they were so good to him. I fried in Avocado oil since they were thin and didn't take long to cook. And they were just right in flavor and not dry at all! Thanks for sharing the recipe! Definitely on my recipe list to keep!❤️ We really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe as is and it was so easy and tasty.  The only thing I did before serving is I topped it with some mozzarella cheese before serving it.  I will definitely make this again! I liked everything in the dry ingredients. However, I added, onion powder, garlic parmesan powder, and fresh grated parmesan.Mmm good! None
