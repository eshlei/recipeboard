yum! i used cornstarch instead of the flour it called for and it worked just as well. instead of boiling the pecans in sugar water, try toasting them in a sauce pan with 2 tbsp of butter and then 2-3 tbsp of brown sugar. It never ceases to amaze me how people always seem to change a recipe greatly, then make either positive or negative comment. Their recipe is not the recipe given! Just saying! Walnut shrimp is one of my all-time favorites and this recipe was right on. I've had this in Chinese restaurants several times and really enjoyed it. Having a decidedly sweet shrimp dish is somewhat unusual so you need to be prepared for that difference. I made this recipe as written. My only complaint is that the coating did not stay on the shrimp after frying. I also added some fresh lemon juice to the sauce which made it perfectly tangy and good. I will make this again for sure. I served it over jasmine rice :-)
