Easy Crab Cakes

Mix crabmeat, eggs, mayonnaise, red and green bell peppers, parsley, baking powder, Worcestershire sauce, and seafood seasoning in a large bowl until blended. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Working in batches, use a tablespoon to carefully spoon poker chip-sized mini "cakes" into the skillet; batter will be loose. Cook on one side until firm, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned and heated through, about 1 minute more.
I hate to do this but I've never had a crab cake fail until this recipe. Taste was fine, method however was not. The batter is too loose and by the time they set enough to be able to flip, they were too done and had a spongy pancake like texture. What you see in my picture is as written. For the rest of the batch I used oil instead of the non-stick spray. They still didn't hold together but color and texture improved.
