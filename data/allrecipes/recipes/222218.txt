Excellant! I made a double batch for a picnic and none was left. I went a little lighter on the sugar and used half the milk and half the buttermilk called for and it was perfect! I also used a grater to grate the onion into the dressing so it would be distributed well. Very very pleased with this recipe. It was the ideal blend of snappy and sweet. Thank you Krissy. This recipe was just what I was looking for.  We loved it, however it was a bit watery.  Next time I will try 1 tablespoon  of both the vinegar and lemon juice. i changed two things. I did not use any sugar and added a teaspoon of lemon because I didn't have buttermilk. I used a half cup of milk and everyone liked it Delicious as is. You don't need to buy buttermilk. Simply mix a tablespoon of vinegar into the milk and leave on the counter for 5 minutes and stir. Instant buttermilk! I also use bagged coleslaw mix when pressed for time and chop it up very fine. It was okay but it turned out quite soupy. I added more salt and pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. I eliminate the milks and use wine vinegar i added tomato,onionred peppers I USED VEGANIZED BUTTERMILK, VEGAN SUGAR, RICE MILK,  VEGANAISE So simple and easy to make but I felt that it lacked a bit of flavour. I read through the other comments and added onion powder and paprika and it was much better.  But as a base recipe, it's really good.
