Vegetarian Moussaka
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25311/vegetarian-moussaka/
Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook eggplant and zucchini in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving as much oil as possible in the skillet. Add more oil to the skillet if needed and let it get hot. Cook potato slices in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, again reserving oil in the skillet. Saut√© onion and garlic in reserved oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in vinegar, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low; cook until liquid is reduced in volume and thick. Stir in tomatoes, lentils, 1/2 of the juice from lentils, parsley, and oregano. Season with salt and black pepper. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant, 1/3 of the zucchini, 1/2 of the potatoes, and 1/2 of the feta in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the tomato mixture over vegetables; repeat layering, finishing with a layer of eggplant and zucchini. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir milk, flour, and butter for together in a small saucepan; bring to a low boil, whisking constantly, until thick and smooth. Season with nutmeg and black pepper. Remove from heat, cool for 5 minutes, and stir in beaten egg. Pour sauce over vegetables and top with Parmesan cheese. Continue baking, uncovered, until sauce is bubbly and top is lightly brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
This was DELICIOUS! And I agree with previous reviewer, it can be done in no time at all! First, I couldn‚Äôt find canned lentils, so I bought a bag and because I was doubling the recipe, I estimated and used ¬Ω the bag. I soaked them overnight, then added some chicken broth and boiled them for 15-20 minutes. Agree with previous reviewer....don‚Äôt fry each veggie..just roast them all together! If you don‚Äôt have one already, get a mandolin ‚Äì Pampered Chefs new one is GREAT! I peeled the eggplant and sliced it up. Then sliced the Zucchini (didn‚Äôt peel) Beset change was that I used RED Potatoes, which I love anyway, but better yet, you don‚Äôt have to peel! I put it all in a big roaster pan, coated them with Peanut Oil (can handle higher heat) and roasted them at 450-500 for 30-50 minutes (my oven cooks fast). While they were cooking, I cooked up my onions and garlic added in the tomatoes, lentils, oregano and parsley and the cooked lentils. (I took previous recommendation and added some cinnamon to this mixture)I layered 1/3 of this vegetables in the bottom of my 9x 13 pan, then ¬Ω of the onion/tomatoes mixture, then sprinkled Feta Cheese. Repeat (1/3 veggie, rest of onion/tomato/feta) then top with remaining veggies and feta. Bake for 25 minutes.For the B√©chamel sauce ‚Äì I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg to this and it made it perfect! Since I had doubled the recipe, I doubled this sauce ‚Äì but I only used ¬Ω.I‚Äôve made twice since and am making it again his week for  I said something like, ‚ÄúMm so good, best thing I‚Äôve ever tasted.‚Äù My husband‚Äôs reaction was, ‚ÄúYeah..it‚Äôs good,‚Äù which is high praise from him Ingredients were fantastic together . Delicious This recipe is ridiculous. First, as others have said, it is VERY labour intensive.  Second, the quantities are WAY off if you want to fill a 9x13 serving dish. Third, if you just dump your flour into your milk/butter like that, no amount of whisking is going to remove the lumps unless you have bionic arms.  That's only part of what's wrong with this recipe.   Nice idea, but I will look elsewhere for my vegetarian moussaka recipes from now on. Waayyy too labor intensive. I followed the recipe but used a non-stick pan instead of the oil that would have been required. It was tasty and my husband liked it but the end product wasn‚Äôt worth all the frying. To me it was like ratatouille with a mild cheese sauce on top‚Ä¶and that could have been done in 20 minutes!!! Takes time indeed, like 2 hrs. Hands-on! just frying all the thinly sliced veggies 3 min per side in multiple batches takes about 50 minutes. By the time you go through all the steps start to finish this is more like 3 + hours.All the veggies, especially the eggplant are oil sponges. The oil you have to keep adding amounted to 1/2 bottle of olive oil! Even draining everything on paper towels (1/2 roll later) does not soak up most of the oil.The 'sauce' is a bechamel sauce. Throwing butter, flour and cold milk together and whisking to boil is a lumpy thin mess that doesn't thicken. Look up a bechamel sauce recipe before making this. Butter and flour are browned first slowly while the milk is heating separately. Add milk GRADUALLY while whisking continuously. It also takes like 20 minutes to bring to low boil.So by now you are in grease-land...You don't need the liquid from the lentils. Too soggy.And baking this is more like 75-90 minutes....Very frustrating experience. Delicious üëå It's a decent base recipe. One can of lentils is not enough for 2 layers. The author saut√©s the onions, mixes them with lentils and tomatoes and then, when assembles, miraculously pulls them separately from the mix and layers them? A note on frying eggplant, zucchini and potatoes - too much oil, recipe calls for 1 Tbsp for the whole dish - unreal. I suggest precooking eggplant and zucchini in a microwave with a bit of water and boil sliced potatoes to half-cooked state. Dish comes out way less oily and healthier. You can also start thinking about replacing white sauce that goes on top with a mixture of yogurt and eggs.   The end result is very good and tasty without that many calories. excellent ingredients, TERRIBLE instructions.  You assume way too much basic knowledge and you left out whole section.  Also, bake vegetables instead of frying! Much less time, less fat.  I know how to cook so I have no problem assembling but would not recommend to a not-so-experienced-cook! We were disappointed in this dish. It was  a bit time consuming and not flavorful enough. I did roast the vegetables instead of frying to decrease calories. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Really needed more spices and a lot of salt. Family ended up putting sriracha on it which made the dish ok. Not a keeper for sure.
