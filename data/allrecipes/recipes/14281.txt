This recipe is so good, my whole family loved it. My dad wanted me to make more, so he could take it to work the next day. since he is on a diet, i used non-fat plain yogurt instead of mayo and he didnt even know the differnace. using the yogurt instead of the mayo cut out a lot of the fat, and not a lot of the taste. will continue to make this recipe with yogurt. Love this recipe. It's always my go to. The only thing I changed is omitting the sugar. I just don't think it needs it. Like it the best. Used green onions  instead of red onions. Personal preference. Delicious. Also sunflower seeds & dried cranberries. Worth making.  Better than any store bought. A little lighter on the pepper and a little heavier on the lemon.  Let it sit until cold. Always a hit! I am going to make it this weekend. It looks yummy. Love this.  I also add sunflower meats, and golden raisins I make this salad alot and I put in toasted sunflower seeds  or roasted candied almonds.  It is so good with the raison like cranberries.  I love sweet and savory.
