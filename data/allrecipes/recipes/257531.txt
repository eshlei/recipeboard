Flatten each piece of white bread using a rolling pin. Whisk 1/4 cup butter, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, milk, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Spread cinnamon butter mixture onto 1 side of each piece bread. Roll bread around the cinnamon butter. Dip rolled bread into the egg mixture. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook the dipped bread rolls until golden, about 2 minutes per side.
These were awesome. Had a church Breakfast potluck. First I used 1 8 oz brick of cream cheese. Split in half & I used cinnamon with 2 Tbsp white sugar 4 oz cream cheese softened. With the other 4 oz cream cheese I added 2 Tbsn white sugar & 1/3 cup strawberry jam. Instead of nutmeg in with the egg mixture, I added 2 tsp vanilla extract & rolled out white decrusted (my own word!) bread - 2 store bought loaves worth. Used 6 x-large eggs and had some leftover. Made 42 rolls, which I cut in half to serve. These were devoured! Awesome recipe. It is a really good recipe I added a little cinnamon  sugar and I didn't need sryp .U should try  this Loved it!!!

So many possibilities.
