Severed-Finger Cheese Sticks
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239784/severed-finger-cheese-sticks/
Round off the ends of each cheese stick with a paring knife to resemble a fingertip. Roughly tear each cheese stick in half to form two torn-off "fingers". Shave off a piece of each cheese "fingertip" to form a nail bed; place an almond slice on the "nail bed" to form a "fingernail". Cut a few shallow lines in center of each "finger" to form knuckle marks. Pour several drops of hot sauce into small pools of "blood" on a serving plate. Dip torn ends of the cheese fingers into "blood" to resemble bloody fingers. Lay each "finger" in its own pool of "blood".
A fun, fast and easy recipe to make for a Halloween party for the kids.My daughter said they look disgusting, just what I wanted to hear! Loved the look of it! I used pumpkin seed for the fingernail This was such a fun appetizer for the kids prior to tick or treating. They were totally disgusted and love dipping the "fingers" into the "blood". The only change I made was serving with leftover Chef John's Pizza sauce since the kids aren't into hot sauce. Thanks, Chef John! Cute Very good, it was really creative and fun to make and eat! Thanks, Chef John for this: "Ewww! That is disgusting and gross" recipe! We had a lot of fun making it! Only change we used ketchup and cayenne pepper on the knuckle cuts. Happy Halloween :) A fun, fast and easy recipe to make for a Halloween party for the kids.My daughter said they look disgusting, just what I wanted to hear!
