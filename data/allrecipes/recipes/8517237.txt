Place the cabbage, cucumbers, and green onions in a large bowl. Set aside. Add garlic, shallot, lemon juice, chives, oil, vinegar, nuts, basil, spinach and yeast to the bowl of a food processor and blend, scraping down the sides occasionally, until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour dressing over cabbage and toss until well-combined. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Good salad. It seems you could add other vegetables if you'd like. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's very lemony and very oniony as the recipe is written, I'll cut back on both next time. As a vegan and a gardener I loved this so very much bc I could use the plants from my garden! Made this all spring and summer! Good salad. It seems you could add other vegetables if you'd like.
