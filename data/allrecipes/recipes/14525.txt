Beer Steak
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14525/beer-steak/
Place steaks in a large, shallow container with a lid. Season each side of steak with salt and lemon pepper. Gently pour beer over steaks (making sure the seasoning doesn't wash off). Cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place steaks on preheated grill; discard beer marinade. Cook for 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
I LOVED IT!! My husband always seasons the steaks and he was not happy when he saw me pouring lemmon pepper all over his precious t bones but they were fabulous. Very juicy due to the beer and so simple to make. I used Shiner Bock beer and I would definately reccoment a dark beer. Recipe was simple and very tasty.  Steaks were very tender and juicy. Wonderful. So tender! Made as is. Fantastic steak. My new go to steak recipe!! Very good! The hops from the beer made a great flavor This was good, but not the best steak I ever ate. I like steaks and I like beer.....never knew how good they tasted used like this. After several tries I would recommend a dark lager and use a vacuum type marinator  like FoodSaver. Decided to pick up some rib-eyes and try this recipe. Delicious! Used Coors Light and it was so tender and flavorful. Hubby said he was leery of the lemon pepper, but he loved it. I also added some garlic powder. I am not a big fan of steak, but definitely will make this again and again! Honestly this recipe didn't do anything for me. Maybe it was the lemon pepper I used or the beer (Canadian) but neither shone through at all. If I'd grilled the steak maybe things would have been different. The only other deviation, aside from pan frying, was that I seasoned with both salt and lemon pepper before cooking. YES WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN
