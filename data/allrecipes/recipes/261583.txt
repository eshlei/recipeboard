Best Homemade Marzipan

Place almonds in a heat-proof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand for a few minutes until cool enough to handle. Slip almonds out of their skins one by one, leaving the remaining almonds in the warm water. Drain almonds in a colander. Place almonds and confectioners' sugar in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process to a paste. Add cold water, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon at a time, if the paste is too dry. Scrape the sides a few times to ensure even processing. Add a few drops of almond extract towards the end of the process. Process marzipan until it is smooth and no longer grainy. Wrap marzipan in plastic wrap and store in a cool, dry place.
I used to live in Germany years ago. This recipe is spot on! l made this which was very easy and l added about 1/8 tsp almond extract and instead of using water, l used white corn syrup to get it to hold together.... lt was very good and extremely easy to make
