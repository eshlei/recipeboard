Bulk making waffle day--I doubled the recipe. I only made one change, I used half whole wheat/half AP flour. After all the dry ingredients were folded into the wet, I noticed that the batter seemed to be quite thin. I ended up adding an additional cup of AP flour. These puffed up nicely and turned out well. Using half whole wheat flour made them sturdier and more filling. I will use this recipe again. Simple recipe. Very tasty! Soft and tasty, we used regular buttermilk instead of low fat and it was great. Added chocolate chips to part of the batter. I followed directions, which are similar to others, but Waffles came out weird and gummy. To make a smaller batch just cut recipe in half. They were really good, I used regular buttermilk, so the butter was not runny. Easy and quick and delicious my entire family lived these
