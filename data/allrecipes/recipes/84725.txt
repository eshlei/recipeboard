German Semolina Pudding
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/84725/german-semolina-pudding/
Combine milk and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil then immediately remove from heat. (Milk tends to boil over as soon as it boils, so stay with it!) Stir in semolina. Return to medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring until thickened but still pourable. Pour into serving bowls; top with your favorite hot cereal toppings.
I grew up in Germany and love this dish. You can have it in the morning like a hot breakfast or as a dessert. We used to add fresh fruit like cherries or berries to it. My grandmother served a cherry soup with it. Delicious! Good. Be careful as you stir it semolina. It can turn lumpy quickly. I also added one teaspoon vanilla while stirring. I made this for breakfast for my kids - cream of wheat, but better! Used to have this for pudding as a kid in England, made it for my kids and they loved it!! We have strawberry jam stirred through, delicious After this cools down i put it in the food processor and add about 3 spoons of fresh cream and third a cup of wipping cream and a drop of vanilla. Process for 3 minutes then pore on cups. No one can make a different between it and a real ice-cream. Try it with nuts on the top. This is a good recipe and very easy to make. However, it tastes much better with some vanilla flavor. Oh my gosh. I didn't know other people ate it like this, too. My mom made this for us when we were kids. And for our kids too. quick, easy and tasty with cooked apple Ahhh the childhood memories this brings back! :) Loved this!  It is like cream of wheat as one reviewer said.  I added a smidge of Dr. Oetker's vanilla sugar and blueberries.  Even my picky 4 year old liked it. Thank you for sharing this one.
