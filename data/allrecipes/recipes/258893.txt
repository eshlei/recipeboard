Bring 1 quart water to a boil in a large pot; add cabbage and cook until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain. Mix cabbage, onion, apple, lemon juice, and oil. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.
I chose to barely boil the cabbage, just to soften slightly. Followed the recipe and thought the finished product needed a bit more flavor so added 1T cider vinegar. I may add caraway seeds.
