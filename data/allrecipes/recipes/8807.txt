Cover chicken with salted water in a large stockpot or Dutch oven; simmer until cooked through and tender, remove chicken from pot and remove meat from bones. Keep chicken warm while making the dumplings. To make the dumplings: Sift about 2 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture; pour in 1 cup of hot chicken broth, mixing first with a fork, then with your fingers. Add the egg and mix well again. Knead the dough for a few seconds on a floured board. Separate the dough into 4 or 5 parts and roll as thin as possible. Cut into 1 1/2 or 2 inch wide pieces. Break these into 2 inch long strips. Drop into boiling chicken broth and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with previously prepared chicken.
I was quite pleased to at long last discover a recipe which when produced matched my memories of the 1950's and the dumplings my Aunt made for me. This recipe is only missing her sweet presence to make it a duplicate. Thanks.MammaMO I added a can condensed milk and a dollop of Better Than Boullion. My mom used to make homemade dumplings growing up an I loved them i try to make hers the way she did miss u momma ðŸ’“ I forgot to shift the flower and baking powder.  The dumplings a little dense.  But all in all, was really good My family loved it This is a great dumpling recipe I love it the only thing i added was garlic,salt,and pepper to my dumpling mix This is absolutely my go to recipe for noodles/dumplings! You will not be disappointed. I tried the recipe verbatim at first, however I made a few adjustments thereafter per my own personal tastes. Nevertheless the recipe as is, is absolutely phenomenal!
