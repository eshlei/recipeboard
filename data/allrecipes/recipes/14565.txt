Absolutely better than the Naan served in my favorite local Indian restaurant. A couple of comments to clarify the recipe instructions, however: "Proofing" the yeast means that you must add about 1 Tblsp. of sugar to the warm water and yeast, then allow to double in volume prior to adding any further ingredients (I might not have known that had I not stumbled upon proofing instructions on the package). Also, I found that it took a considerable amount of time for this dough to rise, so keep that in mind when you are planning for this to accompany a meal. High heat was way too extreme a cooking temperature. I burned the first few and ended up keeping the heat on medium-low. This recipe had a wonderful flavor, and you could truly eat them alone with nothing more than a little butter. Tasty! You can tell this is an American recipe due to the added sugar. Just leave it out; try to develop your taste buds so they learn to appreciate food that is not sweetened with added sugars. Wasn't a fan of it tasted didnt have the right flavor. It was missing the true naan bread flavor. Greek yogurt is something I highly recommend and ghee if you truly want that flavour. Wish I read the reviews to catch the correct method of proofing. But still had great turnout!I used the bar side of a griddle we have for our grill in the oven at 400 degrees it worked out great! Delicious.  Made the dough in my bread machine with ingredients listed and cooked on cast iron griddle.  So good with lentil soup for dinner. Substituted 4Tbs of creamed raw honey for the sugar (it's what I had) and made the dough using the dough setting of my bread machine. Then portioned balls and filled it with a spinach, cheese, and kale filling before cooking on the stove. So delicious and great texture!!! Omg... this was awesome. I was throwing together a quick dinner. And something just really was missing so I made this... they came out superb!!Just as a suggestion, when you set the dough to rise. Try boiling a kettle of water as if for a pot of tea, and then pouring it into an ovenproof dish below the bowl of dough in an oven. It'll warm up the oven, without getting it too hot and the dough/yeast likes the moisture. Works like a charm every time!! So I absolutely messed up I didn‚Äôt realize I was missing the second page until I put all the ingredients in the dough. However.. it still turned out good and it‚Äôs going to be even better when I do it correctly ü§£ I had asome plain (with garlic mixed in) and I just finished a personal pizza on it! I‚Äôm not a fan of regular pizza crust so this was worth trying and I love it! I will definitely make more after the freezer has none üòç I used whole wheat flour I've made this  countless times. Always spot on.  I usually get away with just a bit over 4 cups of flour.  Can't buy nana more now.
