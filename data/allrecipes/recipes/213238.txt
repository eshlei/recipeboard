Had a friend of ours over for dinner who is new to America (he was born and raised in India) and he said I was spot on with this, but to him it was fairly mild. For us it was pretty spicy though. I should note that I did not add the mustard. I marinated the fish in a turmeric/garlic paste with a little salt and pepper. (Food processor, few drops of water and oil and then blend) this was a tip my friend had given me when I told him what I planned to make for dinner. I also tossed in a can of green chilies and cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 a teaspoon. We absolutely LOVED this dish!! We served it over brown rice and finished it off completely. I can not WAIT to make this again!!! Thanks so much for sharing this!! So good! I tweaked this a bit for personal taste. 1 lb cod, 1/2 tsp salt only in marinade, 5 whole cashews, 1/8 tsp cayenne, water instead of broth and no cilantro. This will be a great meal for guests. Thank You!!! Thatâ€™s my review. Thank You!!! This was amazing!! Besides using half the cayenne (which was just right for me), I followed the recipe as written.  I used cod because it was on sale and looked good and canned petite diced tomatoes.  I made the sauce the night before, which made it pretty quick and easy to get the dish in the oven when I got home from work.  My fish took a little longer to cook, probably because the fillets were pretty thick.  I took it out when the fish got to 130 degrees, and it was perfectly done.  I can't wait to make this again! We made it with cod and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be extremely spicy. We love hot & spicy but this was so hot it was not enjoyable. Next time I would reduce the spice to a bit less than half of what it calls for. Turned out really good but doubled the curry to cover the Swai filets I used. Cayenne pepper was a bit much but still a great dish. Loved it. I did find it pretty salty so next time I will back off a bit on the salt. Also we cut the cayenne petter by about 2/3. We will definitely be making this again! No curry powder. Excellent! My first time making curry and it was fantastic!  I used Cod and Mahi Mahi because that's what I had in the freezer.  The taste of the sauce was absolutely amazing - and very spicy!!!  I even like a little spice but this was hot!
