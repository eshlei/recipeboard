UPDATE: I love, love this salad. For the beets I like to roast them (as you would a potato-1 hour @ 450, wrapped whole in foil) then cubed marinated overnight in vinegar (balsalmic or red wine). I also sub feta for the goat cheese. 9/15/2007:Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory this is the salad I order. Thank you so much for this recipe (its going to save me so much $ to make it at home). The only changes I would make is to substitute pecans for the walnuts and add some roasted asparagus spears.  I made this with Feta rather than goat cheese and added some avocad0. I thought the recipe was very good! It was hard to find the frozen OJ however. Not used as much as before. My favorite salad! Add grilled chicken and itâ€™s dinner. Brought to potluck and everyone loved it! Instead of balsomic I made my own sweet onion vinigaerette. Was delicious and healthy I loved this recipe.  I added a handful  of a salad topper that is a mix of gl a zed pecans,dried cranberries and peppers. I didn't have walnuts. I then found a small half apple and couple of blue berries and a few black berries. Wow it was so good withe the dressing. Will be making for the whole family for holiday dinner. Something that goes well with roast pork , makes potatoes and butternut squash. This has a lot of micronutrients all bundled up in a yummy package!  I added 3 oz chicken breast for a 476 calorie meal.  The candied  walnuts were the best ones I have ever made.  I used roasted beets like a commenter suggested and it was good!  I would have given it 5 stars, but it was a little too sweet for my liking.  If you like sweet salads, then this is for you! I kept it the same and I loved it! So tasty! The dressing is delicious too. This was great! I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception if substituting feta for the goat cheese! Thanks! loved it as is
