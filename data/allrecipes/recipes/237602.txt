Combine cabbage, onion, carrots, and jalapeno peppers together in a bowl. Blend egg, lemon juice, white vinegar, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Slowly drizzle oil into egg mixture through the feeding tube while the food processor is running until mayonnaise is smooth and thickened. Mix mustard, sugar, cider vinegar, chipotle chile pepper, and celery salt into mayonnaise until dressing is smooth and evenly combined. Stir dressing into cabbage mixture until evenly coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 2 hours.
A very different version of coleslaw with a mustard taste. Many people told me they didn't like Cole slaw but they like this. Great recipe as a side dish, or a topping for brats, dogs, tacos, etc. After my first few batches, I've found that I prefer a bit more vinegar and mustard, so I adjust that to my taste. If you are watching sodium intake (which I am), or have jars of celery seed on hand (which I do), that is an appropriate substitute for the celery salt.Don't bother with anything more than minimal modifications like that. This dish truly is good as-is. It was a great coleslaw, though I would make a little spicier next time I made this exactly by the recipe.   It was absolutely amazing.  My fianc√© wanted shrimp tacos for dinner and I used this slaw recipe.  He travels for work and recently was in Houston and raved about the fish tacos he had at a few restaurants there.  He said this slaw is restaurant worthy.  He mooed all during dinner.  Ate 5 tacos and had more slaw on the side. A very different version of coleslaw with a mustard taste.
