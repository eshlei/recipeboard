Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Trim off fat from oxtails. Spread on a shallow roasting pan. Roast oxtails in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. While oxtails are roasting, rehydrate dried mushrooms in hot water in a small bowl for 30 to 45 minutes. Drain, slice, and set aside. Transfer roasted oxtails to a plate and set aside. Drain fat from the roasting pan, reserving about 2 tablespoons. Add 1 cup water to the roasting pan. Warm over medium heat, stirring constantly, to dissolve browned bits. Set aside. Add reserved fat to a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Saut√© onion, carrots, parsnip, turnip, and mushrooms in fat until soft, about 10 minutes. Add browned oxtails. Drizzle brandy on top. Ignite. Pour reserved water and browning over oxtails and vegetables. Add remaining 5 cups water. Add barley, salt, savory, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Adjust seasonings.
Robust flavor and it got better as a left over reheated. A very satisfying "comfort food" on dreary winter days. It was very good.   A little bit tedious.   I will make it again. great! with super good flavor and it will keep you warm during winter,plus very easy to make. This was my first attempt at oxtail anything & am happy to say that the seniors at the local center I cook for loved this soup, the only thing they wanted was some cabbage, so next time I think I'll add that as well. Great hit, thanks for sharing!! Very good we liked this a lot. Even better the second day. I love OxTail Soup, this is easy and very very good. Very disappointing. You can't roast meat at 450 deg F without filling the house with smoke. The resultant soup had an unusual, less than inviting taste. Robust flavor and it got better as a left over reheated.
