This is how I usually make a ham and everyone loves it. My boyfriend will ask for me to make my ham and pineapples atleast once a month. I usually use a boneless ham as I get grossed out by bones in any kind of meat. I also will use canned pineapple in pineapple juice if we don't have fresh pineapple. The only other thing I do differently is I put the brown sugar on the ham first then cook it then make more glaze and add it about an hour before done then again about 30 mins. later. I kind of tripple glaze the ham!! Great recipe!! Even though itâ€™s not thanksgiving my grandma makes this very often and itâ€™s so good! Hopefully you guys see this review! The best ham Iâ€™ve ever hadðŸ˜‹ I always follow the recipe exactly when making it for the first time.  I wouldn't change a thing next time I make this.  I got complimented 4 times during dinner.... The instructions for making the glaze don't really work. I microwaved the glaze at medium for over 40 minutes and it never thickened. I have a good and powerful microwave. I resorted to boiling it on the stove and using a candy thermometer to try to get it to around 250 and even then, it wasn't THAT thick. It was still kind of runny. I would amend these instructions if you can. It all depends on how big the ham is, I had got very huge ham and that took at least 5 hours to cook in the roaster lol but very good recipe :) ham is good but save yourself the time and use your stove top for the glaze instead of putting it in the microwave. doesnâ€™t get hot enough in the microwave. It took forever for the glaze to thicken. I added cornstarch and simmered on the stove..This recipe was terrible!!! it took 2 hours to thicken the glaze , by then the ham was done we used tons of brown sugar added honey and syrup , cornstartch  nothing really helped Awesome ðŸ‘Œ This made a perfect Easter dinner!
