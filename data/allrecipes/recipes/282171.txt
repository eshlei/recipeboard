Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. Spray the counter lightly with nonstick spray. Flatten each unbaked biscuit into a 6- to 7-inch circle. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest. Combine chicken, mixed vegetables, and condensed soup in a bowl; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Remove plastic wrap from dough and press each circle into the bottom and up the sides of each muffin cup. Divide chicken mixture evenly between the dough cups. Sprinkle grated Cheddar over the tops. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 15 to 18 minutes.
These were super easy to make and love by everyone in the family.  My 7 year old enjoyed helping me make them. Delish. Such a great comfort meal! Simple recipe with good flavor.
