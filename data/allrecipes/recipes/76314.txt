I am a firm believer that every martini should have a little vodka in it so... I added 1 oz. of vanilla vodka and and finished it off with a sprinkle of Cadbury Flake. Cheers & thanks for sharing Kristen! i can't even believe i'm saying this, but i thought they were too sweet. maybe it had to do w/the quality of my banana liqueur, i'm not sure. i'm definitely willing to give it another try and i think next time i'll add some vodka as another reviewer suggested. my husband liked it, tho, and i didn't hate it. just thought it was too sweet. My husband and love these. We use Godiva chocolate liqueur. Lo and Behold, I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  I use banana liqueur for making Bananas Foster, but never thought it would make a very good cocktail drink.  Had I not had everything on hand, I don't think I ever would have tried this, otherwise, but it was very pleasant, rich, and enjoyable.  Nice alternative to white russians.  I will definitely make these again! I am a firm believer that every martini should have a little vodka in it so...
