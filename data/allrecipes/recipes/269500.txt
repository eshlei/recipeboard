AWESOME!No changes! Going to try with chicken. So good! I used Pappardelle pasta instead of spaghetti So so tastey If you love chicken noodle soup and thought it would be good with heavy cream, this recipe is for you 10/10 amazing recipe. So easy and tasty. I added shrimp this round, Will be adding to our weekly routine. Do you drain before adding the cream and cheese Added some mushrooms This was a hit!!  Both my boys LOVED it as did I.  I did double the recipe so I used a sauce pot, I used whole wheat pasta and add a bunch of broccoli (Which I steamed beforehand and put in at the end with the cream, parm cheese & parsley) and put in a lot more garlic as were garlic lovers in this house.  Is one of our new favorites ðŸ¤©!
