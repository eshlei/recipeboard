Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté jalapeño pepper and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir black beans, tomatoes, corn, quinoa, and chicken broth into the skillet. Season with pepper flakes, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 20 minutes. Add avocado, lime juice, and cilantro; stir until combined.
Wow this was easy and delicious! I planned extra time to make it since it was a first, but I was blown away at how quickly it was prepared and cooked. I sautéed some shrimp with lime and garlic and added them on top which was the perfect addition. This will be a regular meal in my house! As I was making it, it looked ugly and unappetizing.  I was worried that my kids would reject it.  But everyone loved it, they would have eaten seconds if there were any left.  I am definitely saving this recipe.  And I love that it is healthy and vegetarian.  BTW, putting some queso fresco on top makes it extra tasty! My quinoa did not bloom at 20 minutes.  I added another 1/2 cup of broth and additional seasonings and then cooked it another 30 minutes at low versus simmer.  It turned out great. added onions & chicken Easy, healthy, filling and even my picky kids eat it! This dish was just okay for me. I thought with all the ingredients, it would have been better, more flavorful. Perhaps I just don’t care that much for quinoa. this dish was quick, easy & cheap to make.  I sautéed an onion also & added it in. Great dish for people on a tight budget. It was great for my ninja cooker, easy and so delicious We used an ancho chili blend of spices we had, added chicken and topped with avocado, tomatoes, and shredded pepperjack. Absolutely delicious!
