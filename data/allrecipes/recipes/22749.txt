This is a excellent recipe for banana puddings. I am dieting right now, and I wanted to see what this would taste like with lowfat ingredients, so this is what I did. I used lowfat sweet condensed milk and vanilla wafers. I used 1% milk and lite vanilla wafers. The recipe calls for 14 banana's, but I think that was too many unless you really like bananas. I used only 9 or ten. Also the recipe call for a 12 ounce container of whipped topping. I didn't find the 12, it was 10oz or 16oz, so I used the 16oz. It made the pudding mixture more creamy. And one last thing, you don't need a 16oz box of vanilla wafers, the 12oz box worked great for me. I used a 13x9 baking glass dish and it turned out great. I hope my review helps. Used sugar free cheesecake pudding. Eliminated sweet cream milk. Used stevia to make whipped cream, instead of sugar. It came out sweet and fluffy! Tasted great. Used only 1/2 of bananas also! Wow! How did I only discover this now in my 50s!? This is a delicious recipe, light and so easy/quick to make! It was a hit with my family too. First time I made it I used arrow root cookies since I couldn’t find anything else. It was yummy. I let it sit over night to allow the cooked to soften a bit. I also used light cool whip, low fat condensed milk and fat free pudding. I didn’t measure the cookies (just layered as needed) and used about 6 bananas in total. I made it in a trifle bowl and it was very pretty. Making this again for a larger crowd and will be setting it up in individual cocktail bowls to make serving easier and prettier presentation (looked like a bit of a mess when I served it from truffle bowl so this will make it look fancier lol). I made mine with Gluten-free vanilla wafers and this was the first time I have been able to have banana pudding in 6 years. It was a huge hit with my family. I will absolutely be making it again. Follow recipe as is, but do add crushed wafers on top as seen in picture but not stated in recipe. My friend requested banana pudding for his birthday and after browsing several recipes, I went with this one. It turned out amazing! I had to use 2 3.4oz packages of vanilla pudding because our store ran out of the 5oz one, so I used 3 cups of milk instead. My friend loved it so much he had thirds! It made a LOT too. I used a 9x13 pan and layered it in 3 layers. Super yummy. This was amazing. I had to convert everything to sugar free for my father-in-law, and I had to double the batch, but it turned out great! I received high compliments from all that ate it. :) I used heavy whipping cream instead of frozen whip cream. I added a graham cracker crust on the bottom and in between each layer. I made banana and vanilla pudding and mixed them together to give it a richer flavor. Instead of regular milk I used heavy whipping cream to mix the pudding. Amazing banana pudding recipe! I made my own whipped cream with heavy cream, sugar & vanilla extract. I've been making this banana pudding for well over 10yrs, just made it last wk for hubbies b-day. It is great, this was and probably still is in some circles originally called Banana Pudding Supreme...EVERYONE who's tasted it just goes crazy. My ingredients are pretty much the same, but over the years I've been tweaking them, so this is what I do. I add a couple bricks of softened cream cheese, and instead of vanilla pudding, I use banana flavored pudding mix, also I add in a Lil banana extract. And if you don't want your bananas to turn brown soak them in lemon juice, which also adds that extra umph to this wonderful desert. You really don't need to layer it, to save time, just pour the bananas and cookies in your dish, spread them, and pour in filling, carefully mix and re-spread, put cookies on top for the layered look. But either way, ya simply can't go wrong with this banana pudding. I've used this recipe for years. My son wants it on his birthday instead of a birthday cake. However, instead of bananas, I use frozen strawberries to make a scrumptious strawberry pudding. I use a little of the strawberry juice mixed in with the condensed milk for more flavor, and I drizzle strawberry juice on top along with a few sliced strawberries. People love it! I had to make it with sugar free and fat free ingredients however it turned out perfect. No one knew the changes and I was able to eat with everyone else for a change. Thank you Great short recipe & very tasty!!! Really good and easy to make This tasted so good.  I’m using it as a layer for a cake I’m making and was tempted to eat it on its own.  Thank you!!! I did this twice and it will be my go to recipe! We love it! I made this for a big get-together of old friends from work. It was my first time making. It was a big hit.                                                                                                   This weekend my family will be here for a visit. Will be making for my grandson that's turns eighteen Sunday, sure it will be a big hit with them. Joyce-in Memphis. 14 small bananas?  That's got to be a misprint right. The picture of the ingredients shows 5.
