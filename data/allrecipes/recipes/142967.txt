I loved this stuff. I used whole spices though, roasted them together on dry pan until you could smell the aroma and then ground them all up. Was perfect on chicken tandoori and pulav.  I toasted my spices first.  Idlis, roti, coconut chutney, chickpea coconut curry…. They all freeze pretty well, so I break the Idli steamer out, make my Garam masala, chick peas soaked overnight, w lentils soaked about 4 to 5 hours.  I learned South Indian cooking from my neighbor, she wanted to learn French/Vietnamese…I call that a “fare” trade off:)? This was a life saver when the grocery store had no premixed jars of garam masala.  I may never buy it premixed again! This was better than my store bought version. I was out and needed some and didn't want to run to the grocery. I will use this from now on. Great flavors
