Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place broccoli, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast vegetables until soft, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Chop 1/4 cup of broccoli florets; set aside for garnish. Combine remaining vegetables with vegetable broth, cream cheese, and lemon pepper in a high-powered blender or food processor in batches. Puree soup until smooth. Pour soup into a saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with additional lemon pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls. Garnish with reserved chopped broccoli and crushed red pepper.
I made it with a mix of broccoli and cauliflower florets. This recipe was very simple and easy to make. I didn't have cream cheese so I substituted it with sour cream. Turned out just as delicious. I ate mine over rice and added some cheese to it. Very good and will probably make again
