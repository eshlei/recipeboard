Yummy!!! I'm enjoying one right now and it's awesome. I do like my Cosmo's a bit more sour so the pomegranate and lemon combo is just perfect. I used just plain top shelf vodka, otherwise followed recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this one again! Absolutely delicious!!! New fave THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE FOR POMEGRANATE!!!  We've made this a number of times recently, and its the best pomegranate cosmo recipe I've found yet...  this is now a regular in our house.  And it needs NO changes!!! Perfect martini! A bit bitter from the pom juice. I may add a little more Grand Marnier and a splash of Seltzer next time. I really struggle to make a decent drink but this is it! I used watermelon vodka because that is what I had and it is excellent! Fantastic! Made once with Pom juice once with monin Pom syrup (ran out of power on juice every juice) both were equally delicious! I used Pom Wonderful Pomegranate blueberry juice and Ketel One Vodka,,,perfect! Yum yum yummy! Didn't have lemon juice so substituted with sour mix.  Will definitely make again and again and again. this is elegant and very good for a nice cocktail houryou can float pomegranate seeds on top if you wish I served this to my neighbor on a Friday evening and there were smiles all around
