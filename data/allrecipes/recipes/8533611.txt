Hearts of Palm and Avocado Salad
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8533611/hearts-of-palm-and-avocado-salad/
Peel the hearts of palm into strips lengthwise and cut the pile of strips in half. Set aside. Combine lime juice and vinegar in a small bowl and whisk in olive oil to combine. Season with chili powder and salt and set aside. Combine onion, bell pepper, radish, carrots, tomato, serrano, cilantro, and reserved vinaigrette in a medium bowl; stir to combine. Gently fold in avocado and hearts of palm. Serve immediately.
Yummy!!! This was very good! I had never tried hearts of palm before. It has a mild artichoke-like flavor. It is very soft, though, so be careful when combining it (and the avocado) with the other vegetables, or you will end up with mush. The salad was very nice, colorful, and unusual. I served it as a side with beef tacos.
