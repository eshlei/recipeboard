Swample Punch
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229142/swample-punch/
Mix blue sports drink, sparkling water, wine, peach-flavored drink, energy drink, fruit candies, and vodka together in a punch bowl.
The recipe submitter said this wasn't the prettiest punch but it had a good enough color to me. My only complaint is that it was a little too sweet and I didn't even use the skittles. I'll ditch the peach drink next time and go from there.
