French Toast Corners
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23635/french-toast-corners/
Cut each slice of bread twice diagonally to make 4 triangles (24 total). Set aside. Beat together milk, eggs, vanilla, and cinnamon in a shallow bowl until well combined. Heat butter over medium-high heat in a frying pan or skillet. Working in batches, dunk bread triangles in egg mixture, soaking both sides. Cook bread triangles in hot butter until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve warm.
I like to make this using Texas toast, a thicker piece of white bread. Up the vanilla just a tad and sprinkled some sugar in the mix before dipping the bread. Fast and delicious!  Perfect breakfast for kids’ sleepovers This is a great recipe, my family loves it! we scsa safsaa ssraswcasaeas asnas sasafc sdsa s sacsa Just made this recipe. I didn't have any cinnamon or Vanilla extract, but i substituted a spoonful of HoneyVille Maple Hazelnut whipped honey into the batter and it seems to have worked fine. We put that same honey along with some homemade pear butter on top of the triangles when eating them. I don't think I'll make french toast any other way now Honestly it’s pretty good, it need a little more flavor tho. I kept the bread slices whole instead of cutting them into corners.  I added a little nutmeg and sweet Italian cream coffee creamer to the egg/milk mixture.  So good. Delicious!instead of butter I used coconut oil, I used a full loaf of Challah bread sliced thick and doubled the recipe. I ran out of vanilla extract so I used Pumpkin Spice extract. Next time I will use half pumpkin spice and half vanilla extract. it was good
