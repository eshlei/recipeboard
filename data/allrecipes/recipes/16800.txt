I looked at several Waldorf salad recipes before I settled on this one, based on other reviews. I wanted to find a recipe I could throw all that leftover Thanksgiving turkey into! It's very good, I added a little more lemon juice to counter the sugar sweetness (a good idea is to chop the apples first and then drench them in the lemon juice to keep them from browning!), and where folks had either grapes or raisins, I used Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) to complete the whole leftover turkey-with-cranberries, apples and celery experience! Mom made this basic recipe but added shredded cabbage to the apples, nuts and raisins.  Always better the 2nd day. Just made it today. Excellent recipe. Thank you. Made no changes to the recipe. I think that it is a very good base recipe. I added 1/4 cup sour cream for some tang.  As well as 1/2 cup of marshmallows for additional sweetness. Definitely will make again. Leave the sugar out and it is much better. Swap walnuts for those you like. I did half greek yogurt and half mayo and used a lime instead of lemon. Absolutely delicious. Recipes that are flexible are really the best.
