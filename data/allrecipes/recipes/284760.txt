Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Set icing packet aside. Cut cinnamon rolls into quarters. Dip pieces in melted butter, coat in cinnamon-sugar, and place in the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until dough has risen and top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes; drizzle icing over top and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn the monkey bread out onto a plate and serve warm. hristin
i had too much extra sugar and cinnamon, as well as butter. just poured on top. Simple, quick, and easy. I put it in the airfryer at 400 and it came out great! I used the cinnabon cinnamon roll dough from sam's club. Delicous! Great easy steps, easy clean up, over all great family favorite.
