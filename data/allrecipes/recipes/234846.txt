Pour ale into a pint glass; slowly stir apple cider into ale.
This was good for a change. I used Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat. It was so good that I adapted the recipe just for my gluten-free friends. They LOVED it! I'd rather other options . . . others agreed w/ me. I liked this a lot more than I thought I was going to - it's a pretty great combination of flavors, and a nice light drink for a fall evening. It was okay but I found it a little sweet even though I used a dry cider, one that I don't normally find too sweet. I used Pumpkineater ale from Howe Sound Brewing in Squamish BC and No Boats On Sunday Cider from Andrew Peller Limited in Truro, NS. I did not care for this. This was good for a change. I used Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat. It was sooooooo goood.  I used the Saranac Pumpkin Ale and it was delicious.
