Make an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice water, and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add green beans, and blanch until just tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes (do not overcook). Drain green beans, and immediately add to ice bath to stop cooking; set aside. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar together in a small bowl. Drain green beans well and pat dry with a paper towel to avoid diluting the dressing. Place into a bowl and drizzle with vinaigrette, tossing gently to coat. Transfer tossed green beans to a serving dish. Garnish with goat cheese and almonds.
Love I also add a dash of balsamic vinegar no sugar...
