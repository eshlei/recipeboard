Very tasty, made it just as is. You can switch up the pudding flavors to mix it up. I really like the chocolate, it was just the right amount. I'll have this for dessert every few days. I will be making this a lot more it is so good I think it was delicious. thanks for the recipe. It could be good if you like the taste of overpowering peanut butter. I split the recipe in half and it still tasted like gunk. This was satisfying and amazing. Reese's cups is my favorite candy, and this drink was definitely giving me Reese's cups vibes. Loved it. New to smoothies. Saw this and I had 2 ripe bananas to use so just had to get the pudding cups.  It was SO good!! Hope the fruit/veggie ones are as good :) OH and I used the regular redi whip because thats what I had on hand. Very good! I really loved it Very tasty, made it just as is.
