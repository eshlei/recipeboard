Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Add water and wheat berries; stir once. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions and set the timer for 27 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes, then switch to the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain wheat berries and mix in salt.
Really good!
