Combine barbeque sauce and grape jelly in a slow cooker. Stir in miniature smoked sausage links. Cook on High until heated through, about 2 to 3 hours.
Great and simple. A word of warning: Do NOT use a smokey BBQ sauce with lil smokeys. Use a sweet bbq sauce. Ive been using this recipe for 40 years.  Love this! My grandmother would have this and orange salad with jello when  visited because she knew i loved both. Great recipe!! I make these a lot in the fall for football games! This is a super easy crowd pleaser.  A variant to use to change things up when you want to is to add package of brown gravy mix instead of the BBQ sauce.  Also red or black currant jelly works instead of grape jelly.  It gives a slightly less sweet and more tangy taste. Love this very good!! I don't put as much jelly as required because I don't like really sweet anything, but great combo flavors!! Very good easy I also used chilli sauce instead of BBQ sauce. I also add garlic I was craving this. Alberson's did not have the minis, and the sauce selection was basic, so I used regular sausage and cut it up into chunks, and the cheapest sauce and jelly on the shelf. It was just what I wanted. My Mother made these in the '70s.  Still make them for holiday gatherings. These tasted just like the classic recipe of ketchup and brown sugar. I used Sweet Baby Rayâ€™s BBQ sauce and just a generic grape jelly. Instead of slow cooking I let the smokies simmer in the sauce on the stove for about 20 minutes until the sauce was nice and thick and the smokies well coated. I served them as an appetizer on Thanksgiving and everyone thought they were delicious, even the kids. Will be making this recipe again!
