I have made this a handful of times and it's always been a big hit. I do make a few adjustments though; first I pre-cook the bacon until it's about half done, I don't like mushy sprouts and that's what you get in order for the bacon to crisp up. Next I pour the bacon, any grease from the pre-cooking, the syrup, sprouts and s&p in a bowl and mix it all up, then I add just enough olive oil to coat usually only a couple of tablespoons is needed. I definitely line my baking sheet with foil because the syrup really gets sticky and I cook at 400 for only about 20 minutes. These small adjustments make it perfect every single time. pretty good, even though I still don't like brussels sprouts. Love the base. I recommend 1.5x the bacon, syrup and salt to really jazz up the flavor. This was great! I didn't like brussel sprouts until I made them like this. My husband was the first one to make this dish as a surprise for my birthday-and he doesnâ€™t cook! We both totally fell in love with them. We have them on a regular basis now! I have turned brussel sprout haters into brussel sprout lovers that want the recipe! I've made this a few times for family mealtime and when entertaining friends too - always a hit!  Can't go wrong with bacon and maple flavors.  Thanks for great recipe. OMGOSH, DELISH.  So easy so yummy.  The only thing I added were chopped onions that went in with the bacon to precook, while I cut the sprouts.  This is my first time using this recipe.  I like my sprouts a little crispier, so next time I'll blast a bit with broiler.  But all in all, ooooh lala, so good! I love this recipe!
