Quick Brussels and Bacon
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/150818/quick-brussels-and-bacon/
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, crumble, and set aside. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and cook until soft. Add Brussels sprouts, cut side down. Cook, undisturbed until browned, turning once or twice, 7 to 9 minutes total. Add bacon and stir until heated through, about 1 minute.
We use the bacon grease w/ the olive (or coconut oil we had on hand) and then saute brussels sprouts. Very good & will make again. Extended family members requested this for Thanksgiving this year! I made mine a little different. I half cooked the bacon in a skillet as I had the oven preheating. I used the bacon fat on the brussel sprouts and seasoned them with pepper and Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning and roasted them in the oven for 10 mins. The last minute or two, I chopped the bacon and mixed the bacon in with the sprouts to finish. They were so good. A little heavy for some but very flavorful. I made it for St Patrick's day with corn beef, in place of cabbage.   Now back by,  Husbands popular demand, repeating side with Easter Lamb. Very good!!!! Would make this again. This was the first recipe from this site I tried on my campaign to increase vegetable intake. My partner and I added potatoes and meat as a sort of casserole dish. It was a good framework and seems very adaptable, so I'd suggest it if you're not sure this exact recipe is what you want. Loved it! I had previously made another brussel sprout & bacon recipe (by Paula Dean) that was WAY too much work. This recipe is just as delicious and so easy! My children LOVE this... that's the best compliment for a vegetable recipe!!! So good! I added a few cloves of garlic and squeezed a full fresh lemon on the whole batch  right before serving. My husband absolutely raved about them! Made this with onion.  My new "go to" brussels sprouts recipe!
