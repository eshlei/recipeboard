Thank you for this recipe. It's hard to find an all fruit smoothie that doesn't have milk or peanut butter or chocolate or weird ingredients like flax seed. I used diet sparkling lemonade in place of the orange juice because I'm diabetic. It was very good and portion sizes were large. As it's only me who likes smoothies I add my own touches ..I love smoothies so much that I brought a smoothie maker and it's great...try adding a squirt of lemon or lime into this recipe it's delicious, also I make a mean black cherry raspberry and blueberry smoothie...it's really tasty Very delicious! 👍👍😊🙏🙋💓 Love it. Perfect for summer! Had a few changes just b/c of what we had on had but turned out great! Kids love it! I prepared one batch with Coconut Water & another batch with Mango Coconut Water instead of juice. Simply Delicious! Great basic smoothie. I add flax seed and spinach for extra nutrients. Made it exactly as listed.  Best smoothie I've had in a long time!
