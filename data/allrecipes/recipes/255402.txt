Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes; cook and stir until mushy, about 5 minutes. Stir in miso paste and fish sauce; simmer until flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Pour water into the pot; bring to a boil. Add snapper fillets and radish; simmer until radish softens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in mustard greens, chile peppers, and kalamansi juice. Simmer, uncovered, until greens are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.

It was a success at my house anyway. Awesome recipe! I used powdered tamarind soup base and kalamansi juice to give my “sinigang na salmon belly sa miso” that extra tang which my family loved!
