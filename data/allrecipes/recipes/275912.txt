Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place apples in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Mix in apple cider and lemon juice. Mix together sugar, brown sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and 1/2 cup flour in a bowl. Sprinkle sugar mixture over sliced apples and top with evenly spaced caramel squares. Mix together brown sugar, oats, 1/2 cup flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice for the topping in a large bowl. Cut in butter cubes with 2 knives or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle topping over apples in the baking dish. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Let cool before serving.
This was a wonderful dish ... we had it with vanilla ice cream. I halved the sugar and it was still outstanding!!! This was a wonderful dish ... we had it with vanilla ice cream. I halved the sugar and it was still outstanding!!!
