Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk milk, yogurt, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix gluten-free flour, chocolate chips, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk mixture into the flour mixture until well incorporated. Let batter stand, about 10 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup of batter onto the preheated iron and bake until crisp and golden, according to manufacturer's instructions, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.
good These were delicious. I had some issues with finding the right temperature because they stuck to my machine. This has never happened before. Regardless, these were loved by everyone, even non-celiac. Thank you for the recipe. These were crispy and delicious! The only change I made was to add blueberries at my husbandâ€™s request. Next time I will back off a little on the cashew milk to account for the additional moisture from the fruit. Wonderful recipe-adding this one to our weekend rotation!
