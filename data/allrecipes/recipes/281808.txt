Slow Cooker Shredded Chicken Chili
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/281808/slow-cooker-shredded-chicken-chili/
Place (in the following order) beans, cumin, coriander, garlic salt, oregano, brown sugar, chile peppers, onion, condensed soup, chicken broth, and shredded chicken in a 6-quart slow cooker. Give it a good stir and cover. Cook on Low, 10 to 12 hours.
I really liked the flavor of this and also how easy it was to throw together. I don't think it needs the 10-12 hours cook time but I think it would hold up if you had to be away from your home for that long. There was too much chicken for my liking so I'd scale back on that next time but overall this was a really good recipe.
