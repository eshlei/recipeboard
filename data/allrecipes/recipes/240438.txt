Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.
Easy Roasted Broccoli Haiku: "No need to use bowl. Just toss with oil on pan. Mmmm ... add parmesan!" This couldn't have been easier or more yummy! I bought one of those 12 oz. bags of broccoli florets from the produce department so I didn't have to cut anything - just dumped on the sheet, tossed w/ the oil (1 TB was plenty) and s&p, and 18 min. at 400 deg. was just about perfect! Adding a sprinkle of parmesan at the table was magic, but on its own, just as wonderful and simple of a side dish. I normally steam my broccoli in the microwave w/ butter, lemon juice, s&p, but this was absolutely delicious and something that I'm sure I'll do again and again! Absolutely fabulous and so simple.  The roast came out perfect and I did no changes. I will be making this a lot   Thank you I added garlic powder along with salt and pepper.  Do not bake beyond 20 minutes  or the tops of the florets may burn. I prefer steamed over this method. Good Not a broccoli fan, but this was delicious!
