Almost White Slow-Cooker Chicken Chili
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/267901/almost-white-slow-cooker-chicken-chili/
Combine chicken, chicken broth, water, beans, salsa, tomato puree, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, molasses, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, bay leaves, and salt in a 6-quart slow cooker. Stir gently to combine. Cover and cook on Low until chicken is falling apart, 4 to 6 hours. Remove chicken from slow cooker, shred, and return to the cooker. Stir in pepper jack cheese, Monterey jack cheese, and bell pepper. Cover and cook until bell pepper is softened and cheeses have completely melted into the chili, 30 to 45 minutes more. Adjust salt, black pepper, and chili powder to taste. Remove bay leaves. Serve warm, topped with sour cream and extra cheese, if desired.
I omitted the molasses and nearly doubled the chili powder. I also reduced the chicken broth to 4 cups because the salsa and tomato pur√©e already added a significant amount of liquid. All my kids gobbled it up and half of them even had seconds!
