I made this with Splenda as my hubs is diabetic and truly was a winner! Marinating for a bit helps the raisins to plump. I didn't have pineapple so used a can of mandarin oranges which was lovely!! A great all around salad. Very yummy Waaayyy too much sugar. Completely left it out the second time I made it. The pineapple juice and raisins made it sweet enough.
