Very good! I subbed pickels for the green onion and used dijon mustard. I liked the addition of paprika. Served it on a bun with lettuce, tomato, and a few more pickle planks. Thanks Wifey!! Delicious!!! I added a few strips of chopped nitrate-free turkey bacon. My family isn't too crazy about a lot of mayo, so I started with 2 tablespoons my first time, then added a tablespoon at a time until I liked the consistency. Also, for those watching their sodium levels, I didn't add any and it still tasted great. I served this on toasted brioche bread. I've made this recipe twice now, and this time around, I tripled the ingredients of the recipe for those who asked for seconds. Thank you for posting and sharing ! Good recipe. I added 8 dashes of hot sauce and 2 Tbls pickle relish. Then used my hand mixer to blend it. Made great sandwiches! I was tasked with making egg salad for my boyfriends mom coming over tomorrow. This seemed easy and so I settled on it. I woulda went 3 but boyfriend says 4 so I went to that due to him and well inspiration. I realized with never making it before I needed to do it like we like deviled eggs basically. First go I made as is (hence the 3) then second time dialed back the mayo and added way more mustard and vinegar. Way more like our taste. Thank you for sharing. Wonâ€™t make as it says but will to our personal taste more tangy. Also added some onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne and a tiny bit of lemon juice to this recipe. Yum! Added 3 stalks celery , more green onion , 2tsp dill ,1tsp salt and pepper ,everything else the same , very good on croissants I'd never thought to add mustard, and it was a good addition. When my eggs are done cooking I dump the hot water and crack the shell of each egg as I add it to cold water - then I shell them under running cold water, laying them on a towel and wiping dry before using the pastry blender to chop them in a bowl - makes the job so much easier! Also, use cooking onion instead of green onions. I do prefer the stronger taste. At 72 yrs old it's still nice to learn new ways of doing things. This is a good basic recipe. But, because I was quadrupling the recipe and making it the day before for a crowd, and because I like some crunch and zip to my egg salad, I made these changes: I used onion powder so the onions wouldn't weep, added some chopped celery (dried well on paper towels) and some pickle relish well-drained and blotted on paper towels. The salad stayed a nice thick texture that way. I also added a light shake of cayenne pepper to the mix! This is a great base. I substituted with dijon mustard and ground dried onion since I did not have any green onions. I also added paprika, pepper and lemon dill seasoning. Also, a touch of sweet relish. Served it on a toasted onion bun. Yummm! It's definitely a good recipe to get you where you needed to be! I used miracle whip instead of mayo and added a half cup of salsa to give it a little bit of zip! Came out great! I did not have green onions. I substituted dill relish to taste, and to crunch. I also used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow prepared. Great googly moogly, this was delicious! I will be making it again, and again. For the low carbers, it can be served over lettuce, on slices of cheese, or cold cuts, or it will stand well as a side dish. Try it with slices of cheese, and avocado for a completely hunger crushing lunch. I made pretty much as is but left out the onions and used less mustard. Just made it,  no changes. Different type of egg salad but tasty. No onions for me. I used a bit of onion powder and that was more mild. I also add just a tiny splash of Dill pickle juice to get it a little tang. Excellent and easy as written! good recipe
