Brown Butter Perch
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222336/brown-butter-perch/
Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. Gently press perch fillets into flour mixture to coat, shaking off any excess flour. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat until butter is foaming and nut-brown in color. Working in batches, cook fillets in brown butter until lightly golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cooked fillets to a plate, squeeze lemon juice over the top, and serve.
Really easy and good! The only modification I made was a trick I've learned over the years about fish. I cook the fish about 1/3 to 1/4 less the usual time, then remove from heat, cover and let sit for at least 15 minutes (even a 1/2 hour). The fish stays warm enough and it gets juicier over time and doesn't dry out. I will try again with less flour Yummy.  Easy and quick. Easy, quick, delicious, no changes. Yay! This recipe was very good. Easy to make and tastes great. Far more delicious than I expected. Followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy and delicious.  Will definitely be using it again. I made the perch as directed, with the butter, but it came out kinda soggy, not crispy as I was hoping. Breading did not stick very well. Next time I will just go ahead and fry in hot peanut oil as I usually do. Followed directions to a T. Ended up with a sloppy, partially cooked mess
