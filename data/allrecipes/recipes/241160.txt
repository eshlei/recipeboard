I've made eggs this way for 40 years. I beat the cottage cheese and pepper in with the eggs and add them to the skillet at the same time, then sprinkle with the chives just before serving them. Makes fluffy scrambled eggs. Guests rave about them. It’s exactly what I’ve been craving for years with scrambled eggs!!I won’t make them without the cottage cheese from now on. Delicious, creamy, and slightly cheesy.  I love it! Great flavor and much lighter feel than other eggs and cheeses. Mine seemed a bit watery because of the moisture in the cottage cheese. Maybe ricotta cheese might be more appealing? Such a creamy texture and even higher in protein than eggs alone, I’ll be making them like this from now on all the time! This was amazing! I used chive cottage cheese and was so easy and delicious! I’ve never made scrambled eggs with cottage cheese before, and in fact, have never liked cottage cheese at all. The cottage cheese blended so well with the eggs, and I couldn’t even taste it when the eggs were finished. I added the spinach and 2 sliced grape tomatoes; it was so delicious. I seasoned it a bit, but other than that, I will definitely make this again and experiment with other spices and maybe onion/garlic.
