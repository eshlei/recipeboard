Place potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Add butter to potatoes in the pot. Mash using a potato masher, ricer, or mixer until smooth. Gradually beat in heavy cream until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
This is similar to how I make mine. Just a hint to those of you that complained of gooey, etc. Heat the cream/milk and butter before mixing it. Never use cold milk and butter. I just heat it 30-60 seconds in the microwave when I'm ready for it. Delish!!!! Mashing by hand is best. If you must use a mixer don't use high setting and don't over mix. The comments that the potatoes were "gooey" or "glue-like" is a function of over blending. I've made my mashed potatoes like this for years, only I put the drained potatoes back in the pan and back on the burner for several minutes to dry them some what and add a heavy amount of garlic powder and onion powder before mashing them. I only use Yukon Gold potatoes because they have the best flavor. YUM! Perfect every time. Delicious! It tasted a little bit sweet somehow! Definitely creamier, but it was fantastic! I boil 5 whole cloves of garlic in with the potatoes and mash them in with the potatoes after draining. Add all liquid warm. Adding cool liquid to hot potatoes will make them sticky and gooey, not creamy. I also use seasoned salt. Heavy cream can be subbed for half n half. simple ingredients, awesome results! Double butter, mix with hand mixer as little as possible. Delicious! Very good, just needed to add a 1/4 more milk to make it creamier. This the way I make my mashed potatoes. Add a couple of cloves of roasted garlic to make these rich mashed potatoes really stand apart from the rest!
