Kimchi Mac and Cheese

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse macaroni with cold water and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease one 4-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in microwave and mix with bread crumbs. Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, high-sided pan over medium heat. Add flour once bubbling; whisk for 1 minute. Slowly pour in the warm milk. Whisk until sauce thickens slightly. Remove sauce from heat and stir in Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Add the macaroni; stir to coat. Mix in the drained kimchi. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle the buttered bread crumbs on top. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top, about 20 minutes.
Plan on 10 more minutes cook time, 10 minutes of "rest" time,  and also dirtying up a lot of dishes. With that being said, this is a great recipe! First bite in and I thought it needed salt but after you get some kimchi in your bites...it's perfect!
