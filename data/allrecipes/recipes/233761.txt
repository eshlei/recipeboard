Cucumber Soup with Tomatoes
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233761/cucumber-soup-with-tomatoes/
Place 2 cucumbers in a blender; pour in chicken stock. Blend cucumber mixture until smooth and pureed; pour cucumber puree into a large bowl. Chop the remaining 2 cucumbers. Stir chopped cucumbers, tomato, lime juice, and cayenne pepper into pureed cucumber until well mixed. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
We really liked it. Nice bit of zing with the lime & the cayenne combo gave it good flavor. First, I really hate when people “review” a recipe after having TOTALLY changed it. That being said, I only had lemon cucumbers instead of regular ones. So I used 3 blended & 1 diced of those. No “seeding” necessary w/ those little ones. I also didn’t have chicken stock, so I used chicken broth. After tasting it as the recipe called for, it was good...but was missing the creamy element. I happen to have a bit of our family’s “creamy pesto” (nearly equal portions of sour cream & a little more pesto mixed together) leftover that I had used w/ another dinner so I threw that in. Only about 1/3 cup of the creamy pesto & it took this recipe way over the top. So good. Will definitely make it again the way I did it with the lemon cucumbers & creamy pesto added. Super refreshing & light. My husband made me tell him the ingredients about 4 times because he didn’t believe that it was so simple & yet so flavorful. Yummy I really just disliked it. Sorry :-( The pure, cool, sweet flavors of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers make this ideal for those hot summer days. I used English cucumbers for this along with farmers market fresh tomatoes.
