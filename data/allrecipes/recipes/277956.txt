Outstanding! We loved it. Yes the crab is expensive but why not?  We don't do this every week.  Flavors were great.  The purchased remoulade sauce went perfectly well with the cakes.  Only thing is that with my air fryer I will let it go a tad longer with the times. These were great crab cakes. I used some plain breadcrumbs and reduced the number of saltines to 7.
