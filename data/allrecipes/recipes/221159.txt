Worth tracking down the authentic ingredients! The taste is sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy! Unique! I salted the rim with black lava salt, but the Sangrita really makes it salty enough. Squirt is unique too... try to find it. Made this with "Fresh Sangrita" from AR. This was a really great brunch-y beverage! I don't love super-sweet beverages, so I used lemon-lime seltzer instead of soda, and it was perfect for my tastes. fantastic, old family tradition!  sweat and tangy with just enough spice.
