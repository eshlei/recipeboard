Gather the ingredients. Place corn back in their husks in a large pot of water and soak for 2 hours. Soak wood chips in another container of water for about 30 minutes. Preheat a smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place corn, unstacked, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to the manufacturer's directions. Smoke until corn reaches your desired level of tenderness, 60 to 75 minutes. Combine butter, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, and paprika in a small bowl. Peel back the husks and brush corn with butter mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
First time making these, will let you all know how it turned out.  Looks amazing so far. I made it for a 5.7 lb roast. It took 2.75 hrs. I panicked 1/2 way through that it would not be ready in time so I upped the temp to 275. Then for the last 25 minutes I turned it back to 250 because it seemed to gain temperature fairly fast.It was perfect! This is a good recipe! Iâ€™ve found that replacing paprika with cumin instead is the best way to go. I did not pay close enough attention to recipe, and I put the butter mixture on prior to cooking. It was excellent! In fact, I'm making it again tonight!
