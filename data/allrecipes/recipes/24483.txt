In a large pot, combine limeade, lemonade and lemon-lime soda. Stir in rum (add more to taste if desired.) Mix in the lime sherbet.
(without alcohol)- kids love the sweet taste(alcohol added) - adults liked it but thought it was a little too sweet. Make sure everything is cold when it is prepared. If anything is added that is warm, it makes the whole punch warm. Chill rum before adding to punch. I make this EVERY Halloween, but I use a handle (1.75mL) of rum instead of a 750mL.  This greatly helps with toning down the sweetness.  Hope this helps others who find it too sweet, because I can’t drink it with less rum…but WITH it, it’s absolutely incredible. Substituted vodka for rum. Also added vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) to make it glow in the dark! Perfect for Halloween party, especially under a blacklight. If I could give less than one star I would. Made for kid's Halloween party and they all fell asleep so early! I love the idea and it tastes wonderful. Super easy and a huge hit at the party.  We went through about three batches!  The proportions don't need to be exact and any type of white soda works great.  It never turned the deep green as shown in some of the pix, but that was fine. Made this for my gf's dirty thirty! It was a huge hit & SOOOOOOO delicious!! It was way too sweet and just gross. This was an easy and tasty drink for our Halloween party. Even my fiance, who is a tad picky about her booze and not a big drinker, had two or three glasses. Real good stuff. I used Bacardi rum
