I have a 30+ lb bag of apples from our apple tree that NEED to get used up so I took a chance and QUADRUPLED this recipe (praying for good results...otherwise I huge waste of ingrediants). My only change - I used a more apples than called for (6-7 apples X 4). My prayers have been answered!! My apples and effort have not gone to waste! I now have an economical recipe for applesauce that tastes wonderful and EVERYONE loves! Thanks a million phatcat! I'll be sure to repeat this recipe every fall!! I haven't made it yet but will today. Looks easy and yummy. Need to help cinnamon with Mace or allspice. Add lemon juice and dash of ACV and cook longer,lower Recipe is great. Ingredients proportions perfect. I used 1 each 4 apples; 2 tart, 2 sweet. I substituted coconut sugar for white sugar, added a tablespoons of salted butter and added 1/2 tspn allspice, coriander powder, nutmeg, powdered ginger. I like a lot more spice obviously. Finally I left the skins on so after cooling the chunky apple concoction, I put it in a blender to smooth it out to break down the skins. It was amazing with pork chops, collard greens and roast red potatoes. Leftover sauce wonderful on top of buckwheat pancakes. I made no changes Loved it Yum! Very very good. Thanks. Only thing I did differently was cook the apples right down to mush. My family doesn't like chunks of apple. other than that, awesome recipe.
