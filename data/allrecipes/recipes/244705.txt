Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the carrot and fennel and cook for 5 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the garlic and tomatoes. Stir in the broth and heat to a boil. Stir in the chicken and ditalini. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the pesto and parsley. Season as desired. Sprinkle with the cheese.
I agree that this needs a few more herbs and flavors. I added onion, oregano, salt and pepper...but this is very quick and easy! Serve with garlic bread and a salad...very hearty soup! I had no fennel, so I used fennel seed.  Worked well.  I will definitely make again.  Whole family liked it. I totally disagree with the other reviews.  I made this as directed and my husband and I found the seasoning perfect. I agree that this needs a few more herbs and flavors. I added onion, oregano, salt and pepper...but this is very quick and easy! Serve with garlic bread and a salad...very hearty soup! I didn't care for this as written. I thought the parsley was overpowering and the soup lacked flavor. I finally added onion powder, celery salt and garlic salt to add some taste. I didn't care for the fennel. I would prefer celery and onion instead.
