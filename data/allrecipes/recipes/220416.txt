I love how simple this recipe is. This is just plain comfort food. It all comes together so quickly too. I weighed the 4 oz of egg noodles and measured them - it was about 2 cups in my large glass pyrex measuring cup. Remember your soup will only be as good as your broth / stock. Enjoy! Great recipe.  I used thighs instead of breasts to get more flavor and I added a little flour to thicken the broth, but this was very tasty and hearty soup. Easy to make and so tasty! My family loves it, so much I've been making it every couple of weeks! Great simple recipe. I added more chicken due to personal choice. Need to double for a fam of 6. It goes fast! I really liked it, but I had to add more cayenne pepper to give it a little bit more kick. I couldn't really taste the thyme and I even add it more. I also added more stock talk. And I put six ounces of noodles in there instead of four but I need up having more of a thicker soup with lots of noodles and chicken.  All in all, it's filling, hearty and very good It was so easy to make. simple and EXCELLENT!!!... just like ALL of Chef John's culinary wizardry!!!
