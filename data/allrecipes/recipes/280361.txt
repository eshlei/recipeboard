Gather the ingredients. Beat eggs in a wide mixing bowl; mix in sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Dip 2 slices of bread into egg mixture, ensuring both sides are covered; place in the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread. Serve warm.
One eggs is perfect for two slices, especially if you're using stale bread. Sugar isn't needed and you can easily just leave it out. This is a quick & easy recipe. Mama made this & put powdered sugar on top, which is how I have it today. The only change I’ve made is I substituted orange extract for the vanilla.  Making it today going to try lemon extract. I’ve made this recipe numerous times. Thanks SO much Mr. Shiells. 😋 Amazing, if you use 4 large eggs it makes 6 prices of French toast! I wondered if this would taste “eggy” without any milk, but that wasn’t the case.  It turned out well and measured up to other french toast I’ve made..  Used Country French Bread and served with chicken breakfast sausage links and a fresh fruit  salad.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, a nice Sunday morning breakfast.. It pretty good and easy and fast Pretty good and basic recipe especially if you're low on ingredients. I did not use nutmeg, I didn't need it nor had it. Whether or not it would be better with or without, it is still viable to make with no nutmeg.However I will say I did not use regular bread, I had some Pepperidge Farm's Brioche in my pantry and I do believe that boosted the flavor profile. I also made 3 slices and had sprinkled confectioners sugar in between each slice. I didn't use any measurements but used the ingredients and they turned out wonderful Delish so fluffy and soft good
