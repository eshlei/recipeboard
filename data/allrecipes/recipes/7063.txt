Stir in 1 cup milk and yeast mixture. Cover the container loosely and leave at room temperature until bubbly. This is day 1 of the 10-day process. Days 2 through 4: Stir starter with a spoon. Day 5: Stir in 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup milk. Days 6 through 9: Stir starter with a spoon. Day 10: Stir in remaining 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup milk. Remove 1 cup starter to make your first bread. Give 2 cups starter to friends (1 cup each) along with this recipe and your favorite Amish bread recipe. Store remaining 1 cup starter in a container in the refrigerator or begin the 10-day process over again (beginning with step 2).
