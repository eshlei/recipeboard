This recipe was super easy and delicious. I used a variety of apples (Red Delicious, Granny Smith and Mackintosh) and left a little skin to identify the apple and this works for any type of apple. I instead of 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, I used 1 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon, I was little nutmeg, allspice and ginger. My husband and kids loved it as a side for breakfast. Left out the cinnamon, as I am not a fan. Was still delicious! This is the best, easiest and most flavorful recipe I've ever used for fried apples! They remind me of my grandma's so this is the recipe I come back to over and over! I made this with dark brown sugar as my husband wanted. I added a little extra cinnamon and it came out just as my husband wanted. I've never been a fan of fried apples but I've never had them this good before. This is great. I don't use cinnamon, but I do use brown sugar instead of white. It reminds me of when I was little when my memama used to bake apple cobbler for me and my mama at her little 3 bedroom house, I will never forget those days in the farm with my memama and mama
