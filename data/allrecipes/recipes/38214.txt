Combine paprika, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, thyme, black pepper, white pepper, and cayenne pepper. Store in an airtight container.
I've made this as elementary school teacher gifts for the past two years, and the teachers love it. I omit the cayenne and halve the amount of black pepper, then call it "Kid Friendly Creole Seasoning." I keep a batch of this in my cabinet and use it in many things: steak on the grill, baked chicken, in soups and stews, while cooking ground turkey or ground beef; anytime a little kick is needed. I even used it on my Thanksgiving turkey. Thanks for the recipe! Even my picky 6-yr old and 8-yr old kids eat this. Note: to reduce the salt, use Kosher salt; gives it a nice texture without as much salty taste. Love this so much, better than store bought. I reduced salt to two table spoons. on shrimp this is so good. I put this sh*t on everything!  Too bad another Advertiser has already used that, because this stuff is awesome! Its the old two step dude. Laissez Le Bon Ton Roulet. It's authentic as you can get. Look I'm calling mine Voodoo dust üòÅ 1/2 of basil used as I was short the amount needed Best seasoning recipe ever for beef rib roast.
