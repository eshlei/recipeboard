https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/259371/taramosalata/
Place bread in a bowl, cover with water and let sit until the bread is well soaked, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain water from the bowl and squeeze all of the excess water from the bread. Combine bread, olive oil, onion, and lemon juice in a food processor; process until smooth. Add tarama and process until well combined.
I love taramasalata and am so glad that I finally found a recipe for it.  Made this for a remote HH today—it´s fabulous. I did go with the caramalized onions, and added some pepper.  Yummy!
