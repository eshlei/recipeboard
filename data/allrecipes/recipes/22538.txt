Awesome! I used HoneyMustard because I was out of Dijon Mustard. Skipped the butter to save calories and baked. Everyone loved it. Wait till you taste it the day after when it's cold. Use leftovers in a salad! : ) Didn't use butter and it didn't need it.   Also after Stone ground mustard with Dijon.   This was delish!  So moist and tasty It was fantastic!!!! I made my own itialian bread crumbs. Probably didn't use the recommended amount of Dijon, I just put a thin layer on each one. I'll definitely be making this one again!!! I served it with saut√©ed squash and zucchini from my garden and a Ceaser salad. Don't mind my fine China, lol. After trying numerous recipes for oven baked salmon over the years, this one consistently winds up on top with the best taste family award. To deepen the flavor, we sometimes add some garlic pepper but always great either way! Wins a ‚Äú10‚Äù from us!üèÜ I made 1/2 recipe. My fillets were on the thin side but still needed 19 minutes. Next time I will use slightly less dijon. It was easy to make! I baked a potato and made a green salad - good dinner! It came out great! I used tilapia and baked for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Did not use melted butter to save calories. Only used 2T of Dijon to avoid an overpowering flavor.
