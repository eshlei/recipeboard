Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add broth, black beans, butter beans, diced tomatoes, basil, and oregano; bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for at least 10 minutes. Sprinkle each serving with Parmesan cheese.
Very easy and yummy....I had to use chili beans along with the black beans....that was all I had on hand...Butter beans would create a better flavor for sure.... Bursting with flavor even on the first day. Delicious
