Place the block of tofu between sheets of paper towels. Set a plate on top; add a 3- to 5-pound weight to the plate. Press tofu for 15 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Meanwhile, combine water, soy sauce, mirin, and dashi in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside. Remove weight, plate, and paper towels. Cut tofu into 3/4-inch cubes. Place flour in a bowl and lightly coat tofu with flour. Heat oil in a heavy pot and fry tofu until golden-brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Fry in batches if necessary so as not to overcrowd the pot. Place fried tofu in a serving dish and pour sauce on top. Sprinkle with green onions.
Great flavor, will make again, BUT I will not pour sauce over the tofu, it gets soggy. It would be better to dip as I go. Was tasty, just why did we make so much sauce? 2 cups water is too much for one package of tofu. That's all. Make half sauce and perfect. Make sure the oil isn't too hot! Also be sure to drain the tofu into a bowl or sink or something.All in all, a good recipe :) It was quite tasty. Great flavor, will make again, BUT I will not pour sauce over the tofu, it gets soggy. It would be better to dip as I go.
