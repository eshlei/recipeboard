Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, beans, corn, cream of chicken soup, tomatoes and chiles (with juice), green chiles, cream cheese, and cilantro. Cook until cream cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Spread out 1/3 of the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 inch rectangular casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the chicken mixture. Top chicken mixture with 1/3 of shredded Cheddar cheese. Repeat the layer. Top the 2nd layer with remaining 1/3 of the chips and remaining 1/3 of Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover, and let sit for 30 minutes so it can set before cutting into squares.
we all like it except my grandson. he informed me he does not like casseroles lol. This recipe was great as is, my family ate up all of the leftovers.  And they never do that.   You need to correct the size of the Fritos bag however.  Fritos come in a 9.5 ounce bag, and this is sufficient. Delicious! If you love Chili Cheese Fritos, this is definitely for you! However I am sure it would be great with Doritos or regular corn chips if that's what you had on hand.I followed the recipe exactly as written other than using thawed frozen corn because I had forgotten to buy canned. I divided the filling between two smaller casseroles so that I could freeze one for later and I am so glad I did, because we will definitely want to have this meal again. Adults and kids all gave it two big thumbs up! we all like it except my grandson. he informed me he does not like casseroles lol. Easy to make and full of flavor. really spicy Great!!
