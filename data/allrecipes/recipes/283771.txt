Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and peel potatoes. Place potatoes into a large bowl and mash with a potato masher. Add flour and eggs; mix until well combined. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Use your hands to shape potato dough into oblong dumplings with two pointy ends. If dough sticks to your hands, rinse them under cold water. Bring water to a boil in a large pot over high heat, then reduce to just a simmer. Working in batches, cook dumplings in just simmering water until they float on top. Use a slotted spoon to transfer dumplings to a large bowl of cold water. Remove with a slotted spoon to a colander; drain well. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© Schupfnudeln in hot butter until golden brown and crisp on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Soooooo Delicious! My mom would make these on Saturdays,  because Sunday was Grab-Day, so we'd get to reheat them for another love treat   Kim Too dense and chewy, no taste , needs spices added
