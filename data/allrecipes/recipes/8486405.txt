Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the pretzels in a single layer on the tray. Place a single Hersey's Hug on the center of each pretzel. Bake until hugs start to melt slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. You want the chocolate candies to be soft but not entirely melted. Remove from the oven and quickly place a candy corn on top of each hug, pressing down to secure in the chocolate. Move to the fridge to cool for about 30 minutes.
Very simple to do. However, Iâ€™m going to stick to the Rollo bag recipe with the pecan on top. Easy to make, even a child with adult supervision could make these. I found 4 minutes was long enough in my oven.  Delicious! soooo goood loooved ittttt
