Good. Did you know you can cut flour tortillas into strips for noodles?...Like homemade? This was good. This is not like mom used to make but I knew that going into it. I used canned chunk chicken. I shouldâ€™ve used lower sodium chicken broth because it ended up being a little on the salty as a salt lick side. Couldnâ€™t find regular biscuits so used one can of jumbo sized 16 oz but cut each biscuit in 6 pieces.  The dumplings were still larger than I would have liked. Great hearty taste. An easy take on comfort food. Adding some celery and carrots adds to the flavour and texture as well as using rotisserie chicken adds even more spice! I love it thank you it tasted great Great recipe. Quick and easy. Only thing I put peas and sliced frozen carrots. Gives a little home feeling I added celery/onions and carrots I made this and my family loved it! I used rotisseeie chicken and cream of chicken soup with herbs. Super good ðŸ˜Š and better yet, super easy and no mess
