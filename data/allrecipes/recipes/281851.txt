Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add 1 can of beans and smash into the onion using a potato masher. Transfer onion mixture to the bottom of a slow cooker and add remaining beans, chicken broth, shredded chicken, tomatoes, chiles, garlic, cumin, oregano, and cayenne. Cover and cook on High until reduced and thickened, about 4 hours. Garnish with Monterey Jack cheese.
Loved that this had more of a soup consistency but I thought it could use more..well chili flavor.
