Pan-Fried Pork Chops
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8495583/pan-fried-pork-chops/
Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick. Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with flour on both sides. Use the back of a spoon to distribute the flour over the entire surface. Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Carefully add pork chops and pan fry until brown, about 4 minutes. Do not disturb the chops until ready to turn. When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan fry the other side until no longer pink on the inside and brown on the outside, an additional 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Reduce heat, if they are browning too quickly. Serve warm.
Simple way to pan fry the chops. Delicious Absolutely delicious I had never even thought of using flour to fry my chops so this was an experiment. OMG. I will never make them without flour ever again! Juicy, flavorful, with the perfect crust! Perfect. No changes. No added ingredients at all. Delicious just the way the recipe was written. Thank You SO MUCH. ðŸ˜Š I added sliced pineapple. Iâ€™ve made this twice and it turned out great both times. The recipe is detailed and easy to follow. The chops cook to  nice color, and the flavor is delicious. Great way to cook a chop without drying out the meat. Quick and easy pan fried pork chops. In additional to the salt and pepper on the pork chop I seasoned my flour with garlic powder, onion powder, Cajun seasoning and S&P. I been cooking my pork chops like this for years!!!I would suggest using CRISCO grease. Using other shortening products doesn't give your pork chops the crunchy texture like CRISCO does!! I am not a pork chop person: however, I will make this again. Thank you for sharingShirley
