This recipe was pretty good. However, I suggest to not use plain bread crumbs. If you do, add some spices of your own. I made this last night with plain bread crumbs. After I sampled one I realized how bland it tasted. So I sprinkled the eggplants with Garlic Salt, Pepper, and Lawry's Seasoning Salt. That definatley gave it the extra punch I needed after using plain bread crumbs. Layered slices on a pan with paper towels and placed another pan on top for an hour under a five lb weight. Didnâ€™t rinse as they defeats the purpose of getting water out. Wiped down with dry towels. Rolled in flour first step. I used seasoned bread crumbs and they were easy to make and delicious. Wow!! The best eggplant recipe ever! I just put a little spin on the seasoning and it came out perfect! I soak my eggplant in milk, and  season the flour or breadcrumbs then fry it so yummy.
