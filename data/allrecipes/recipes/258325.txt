Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl; cut in shortening until mixture is crumbly. Add milk and sour cream; stir until dough comes together. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface; knead 10 times. Roll dough out; cut into biscuits. Place biscuits on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Quick and easy, and came out perfect. 5 star all the way .People who change the recipe should not rate ! Fluffy was right. These were very good. The perfect biscuit - in texture and in taste.  I've made these several times and each time was perfection. Didn't change a thing.  Photo shows half of a biscuit.  Thank you for sharing! Fluffy light biscuits.  Simple to make too! Very tasty and light. I baked them in a glass dish and they did not get crisp on the  bottom. Next time I'll try an aluminum pan. they were good.  I used an organic shortening made with palm oil. I’ll add more sour cream next time.  Instead of shortening I used butter and oil.  At 10 mins they hadn’t browned (maybe rack should have been higher?) so I broiled for 1 minute.  Acceptable, not fantastic. This recipe was so easy and tastes wonderful!  Light and fluffy just the way I like them!  Yum I made this recipe again and experimented using bacon grease that I chilled and added for flavoring the dough. You might need less salt depending on how salty is your bacon. Even with my substitution, the recipe came out fluffy and light like every single time I make this recipe. This time it came out more savory than usual. Will continue making this recipe!
