I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family. These are delicious, just follow directionsüíñ Good, but seemed to need a bit more flavor.  With so many 5 star reviews, it may just be me.  Maybe my spices are a little old?  I did like the ease of the recipe. I substitute water for milk, otherwise I do it all the same except more parsley and garlic and probably more onion.  They are amazing. So GOOD!  This is the best Italian Meatball recipe I've ever made.  I doubled the recipe and froze most for future use.  I used ground pork and 90% ground beef.  I also used my smallest ice cream scoop to make the meatballs and doubled the recipe.  I am saving this recipe and will make it again. Easy and delicious!!! These are fantastic.  Great flavors.  Perfect texture.  I didn‚Äôt have Italian seasoning blend so I used a mixture of dried oregano, thyme, rosemary and basil.  My son and his friends ate them up and husband thought they were just as good or better than any restaurant. 2nd time making these: so good. but forgot!! that I needed a pasta sauce to complete the recipe. Had some in pantry, yes! and then had a hard time deciding what to serve with them. ‚ù§Ô∏è I love these meatballs. I make them with every pasta dinner I have.They are easy to make and delicious to eat Chef John is a genius. I've made these meatballs many many times. Well worth the prep and effort. Freeze portions easily. I add minced green bell pepper.
