Apple Crisp Topping
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/259609/apple-crisp-topping/
Combine brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Cut in butter until blended and the mixture resembles small peas. Mix in oats with a wooden spoon.
It was easy to make and there is room for substitution. I used pancake mix instead of flour. Depending on your oven, it does not take 30 minutes to cook. Check during baking to avoid overcooking. I love this recipe as is! This is my basic, or classic, go-to crisp recipe. I do change it up sometimes for variety. I use nutmeg sometimes, or this local spice blend I get from my local Renton, WA farmers market called “Sweet Honey Gold” made by Dupree Seasonings ( so good)  but the classic version is wonderful all by itself. Just use real butter yall! No margarine or substitutes, is my advice. I’ve used this over blackberries, apples , peaches, pears and a mix of a few, or all of them. Just little tweeks can change it up a lot, so be creative. Thanks for this easy to remember tried and true recipe.  Love, love, love it! Perfectly crunchy! Used as topping over canned apple pie filling in a baking dish. Baked recommended time.Served overVanilla ice cream! Yummy! Thank you! I added 3/4 cup organic granola and lowered the oats to 1/4 cup. A pinch of allspice & nutmeg, plus heaping tsp of grnd cinn.  It was a hit with my family & friends. This tasted fine and crisped up nicely. It had too many oats and not enough sugar for my taste though. It was easy to make and there is room for substitution. I used pancake mix instead of flour. Depending on your oven, it does not take 30 minutes to cook. Check during baking to avoid overcooking. Fabulous!!!!
