I make a salad similar to this all year long (but with less pepper). I really prefer apple cider vinegar or white balsamic which gives you more tang instead of the very mild white vinegar, but this is a personal preference. I was a little concerned with the amount of pepper, but it was fine. You really can't go wrong with this simple salad, as it will complement most anything you're serving. I omit the water and we love it! My mom used to make this all summer long. I have tried for years trying to get the right proportions of water to vinegar, and never got it just right. I also don’t remember her using oil in the mixture, but it works beautifully. Thank you for this PERFECT recipe! Great recipe... Substituted red wine vinegar for the white vinegar and olive oil for the cooking oil. I love this recipe! Easy and quick to make. A great substitute for lettuce salads. I did make a few changes, I put in a little tobacco sauce and also added a few sprinkles of accent. Very good start. I left out the water. Next time I’ll add some pepperoni .Thanks for sharing
