Combine blueberries, sugar, water, and cornstarch in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.
I've made this many times over the years, so simple but I use less sugar......measuring all else is subjective.Especially if someone-ahem- already ate a handful or two. :-) Very good taste and texture. Lovely color.  I added a bit of lemon juice (1+/- teaspoon) to balance sweetness. I made this for serving with waffles This is now my go-to blueberry sauce.  Also used strawberries with equally excellent results.   After about the third time I made it, I added about 1/2 tsp lemon juice.   Just a personal preference, but this is perfection just as written. Just like it says....easy. No changes made. Great taste! Really easy, really fresh tasting and delish! Lovely. Add the zest of one lemon and itâ€™s FABULOUS! Very easy and so good! Really good! Used less sugar and no cornstarch. Nice and easy and quick. super simple. We loved it.  I doubled the berries and kept the sugar the same.  We did not have fresh berries, so had to use frozen and just cut the water in half.  We will never have waffles w/o this again!
