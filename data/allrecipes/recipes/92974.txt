Set a nonstick skillet over medium heat. In a medium bowl, stir together the pancake mix and flax seed meal. In a separate bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the milk and eggs. Pour the liquid into the dry ingredients, and stir just until moistened. Spoon 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the hot skillet. Sprinkle with as many blueberries as desired. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until browned on the other side.
These were really good! Instead of using a boxed pancake mix from the store I used the homemade pancake mix recipe from this site. I followed the recipe as stated and did use frozen berries. I put flax in many different bread and muffin recipes I make from allrecipes, and now pancakes!  These came out nice and fluffy and delicious! Very good pancakes.  I added some vanilla and cinnamon to them for added flavor. My three fussy boys and one fussy husband loved these! I had to pur√©e the blueberries and mix them in for the fussiest of the fussy but they were a big hit! This was a delicious pancake and an easy recipe to follow. It turned out well! I did however use other reviewers ideas, like making and adding a compote to it and I also Toasted some pecans to add a top of it as well. Very good. Didn't make any changes. Hope they freeze ok These were epic I have made these pancakes several times, and they have always turned out great. Healthy and delicious! Nice...never put flax in anything until this recipe and it worked fine and dandy.  Wouldn't even notice it, but for the color. Pretty good, could use a little more flavor in the pancake itself, like some sugar and lemon juice, but a solid breakfast recipe.
