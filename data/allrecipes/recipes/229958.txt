This recipe is easy and delicious. I usually leave out the hard boiled egg however. Loved it.  No changes made or desired. Very easy to make and the result was delicious! Like some of the other reviewers, I lightened up on the cornstarch, but other than that, a snap! This was supper easy and extremely yummy!! I never made or ate turkey giblets gravy before and I will definitely eat this and make it again?? I’ve made this the last few years as written except I do not strain the broth since it is gravy.  My family loves the flavor.  While I use my grandmother’s cornbread dressing I’ve ditched her gravy recipe for this recipe. I followed this recipe to a T and it is delicious. An amazing gravy! I am one who consistently fails every time I try to make gravy! It was delicious and everyone loved it!!! Easy to make and a great recipe!!! I think the starch should be cut in half. I usually follow all directions the first time and the taste was great but I like my gravy a little more runny... I am a Giblet fan now...
