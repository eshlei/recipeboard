Place at least 1/2 the fresh parsley and 1/2 the dill into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a slow cooker. Scatter about 1/2 the clementine sections on top. Add turkey breast. Combine onion flakes, dried parsley, turmeric, onion powder, salt, sugar, celery seed, and black pepper together in a bowl and mix well. Sprinkle generously over the turkey breast in the slow cooker. Spoon dollops of cranberry sauce all over the turkey and in the corners of the slow cooker pot. Add remaining fresh parsley and dill. Finish with the remaining clementine sections. Cook on Low until turkey is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 hours, checking after 4 1/2 hours to make sure it doesn't overcook.
