Mix in cinnamon and water; continue cooking until apples are soft and sticky, 1 to 2 more minutes. Spread apple filling onto a plate to cool. otdash Meredith Food Studio Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.

This recipe is amazing! I chose not to peel the apples in order to retain the nutrients. In the end, I suspect the filling would have been softer had I peeled them; however, I did not care for its extra effort. The next time I make this, I will add 3/4 t. ground nutmeg when adding the cinnamon for flavor. Do yourself a favor and make the buttercrust pie dough used in Chef John's video for a mouth-watering, super-flaky crust. For that recipe, go to foodwishes.com and type 'buttercrust pastry dough' in the search box. Click on the first link. Voila! I used store pastry, I added some cornstarch/water to thicken the apple mixture.  I used my empanada cutter but I guess I put too much filling cause they all split open but they are very tasty.  The next ones we eat will have some simple glaze added. I have looked for a recipe to make a flaky crust for a long time! And, I was wanting to make hand pies. What luck to find both in one! This was a lot of work but I learned that using the Cusinart was better than the Ninja to mix. I had to use both and learned the stop-start is easier on the Cusinart than on Ninja. The filling was delicious and the flaky crust cannot be beat. I will use this again and again. Also, for the filling I had to use Granny Smith, since that was what I had. Worked wonderfully! I would say definitely put more apples then you think in the dough Wonderful way to serve pie in a lunchbox! It was a hit!  Instead of sugar I used 1/4 cup of honey, and next time I think Iâ€™ll add a little nutmeg to the cinnamon. I used Grandma's Pie Crust recipe and cut pie shells into 8 inch circular shape and cooked my apples, etc. according to the recipe below and used the egg/milk mixture to coat the shells after they were billed before baking and they turned out FANTASTIC.  If possible, they actually taste better the next day.  I will definitely keep using this recipe  to take advantage of the abundance of apples available in the fall! More work than a pie, but I like the higher crust to filling ratio. I used the buttercrust recipe linked in this page. I made the dough and the apple filling. Didn't change anything. Well, I halved the filling recipe because I was short an apple, but it was delicious. This recipes is great. I added a touch of flour to the cinnamon in the last step for a little thickener. I made them exactly as the recipe stated. But the crust split open while baking. Not sure why but it still tasted great.
