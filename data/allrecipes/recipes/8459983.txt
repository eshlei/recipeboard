Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss together cauliflower and oil in a bowl. Spread cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast, stirring once, until cauliflower is tender and just starting to brown, about 30 minutes. (Do not overbrown cauliflower or it will become bitter.) Reserve 1/2 cup florets for garnish and keep warm. Let remaining cauliflower cool slightly. Combine cooled roasted cauliflower 1 1/3 cups broth, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in blender or food processor, working in batches, if needed. Cover and blend until smooth, adding more broth as needed to reach desired consistency. Transfer mixture to a saucepan. Bring just to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat. Stir in cream and 2 tablespoons cheese until melted. Serve topped with reserved cauliflower florets, remaining cheese, the parsley, and if you like, additional pepper.
Slightly bland, so I doubled the amount of salt/pepper/garlic powder, needed to add about 3/4 extra cup of liquid, and the result is delicious. Slightly bland, so I doubled the amount of salt/pepper/garlic powder, needed to add about 3/4 extra cup of liquid, and the result is delicious.
