Banana Pudding with Graham Crackers

Pour milk, pudding mix, and whipped topping mix into a large bowl; mix with an electric whisk or hand whisk until ingredients are combined and a thick pudding forms. Break graham cracker sheets in half to form squares. Cover the bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan with 9 graham cracker squares. Layer 1/2 of the banana slices on top in even rows and cover with 1/2 of the pudding mixture, using a spatula to spread it evenly. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle top with graham cracker crumbs, if desired. Cover and refrigerate until fully chilled, 4 hours or longer. Cut into 9 squares to serve.
This turned out pretty well.  I haven’t had banana pudding in years, and as I recall, it was always with vanilla wafers. The graham crackers worked equally well as a replacement.   I’d never used Dream Whip before, but it certainly thickened the pudding nicely.  I scaled the recipe in half and weighed the Dream Whip (used .67 oz) and 7 oz of graham crackers.  Very quick-and-easy recipe, as well.
