Place potatoes, garlic, salt, and pepper in a slow cooker; stir to coat. Season pork roast with salt and pepper; lay over potatoes. Pour sauerkraut over roast and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours.
I have been making this the exact same way for years and always comes out great. Point is to make sure that the pork stays in the "juice." I always put my roast in frozen so maybe that makes the extra liquid needed to keep the pork moist. My family loves this. Sometimes we even add potatoes to the slow cooker.  Sparingly added a little sugar to take the edge off of sharp salty taste Also added no sugar apple juice (not cider) to bottom of pot. Wonderful, subtle additional flavors. Absolutely delicious as written, thank you for sharing, we loved it ! Been making this recipe from this site for New Year’s Day for years. Had to hop on here and review it. It’s perfect and delicious every year! And serve with a side of stovetop cinnamon apples and warm rolls with butter. Perfect balance.  My wife added some chicken broth, and I placed the potatoes at the bottom.  Everyone loved it including my Asian wife. Used a country spare rib style roast, added carrots and topped it off with browned knockwurst at the final 2 hour point.  Didnt have carraway seeds, it was quite nice! Made this for my father in-law who is German and we all loved it! Super easy to make. Great Recipe Very simple and delicious.  I follow the recipe with the exception of adding 1 or 2 peeled, cored and sliced Granny Smith apples.
