Chaffles with Almond Flour
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/278328/chaffles-with-almond-flour/
Whisk egg, almond flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir in mozzarella cheese; set batter aside. Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spray both sides of the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the waffle iron and spread it out from the center with a spoon. Close the waffle maker and cook until chaffle reaches your desired doneness, about 3 minutes. Carefully lift chaffle out of the waffle iron and repeat with remaining batter. Allow chaffles to cool and crisp up, about 2 to 3 minutes.
This is a great recipe that can be changed up depending on what you're using them for. I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon for our morning waffles! I added garlic and onion powder for my tuna melt. For the grilled cheese, I added a little bacon and onion seasoning. The possibilities are endless! Thanks for a great recipe! Cheddar cheese and taco seasonings for a taco burger... see... get creative! I used cheddar cheese and topped it with cream cheese and a piece of bacon....yummy!! A fake bagel!!! All I added was cinnamon and a hint of vanilla.  AMAZINGLY WAFFLEY!! I loved it, I used egg whites from the carton, came out great, I enjoyed them extra crispy Wanting to make it crispy by despite making it 4 different times I just couldn't make it happen. It could be the mini waffle cooker isn't getting hot enough? I'll keep experimenting . No Dash mini waffle makers available near me so I picked up a more traditional style. It worked great and since I plan on subbing these for bread it saves a cook cycle. Yummy.
