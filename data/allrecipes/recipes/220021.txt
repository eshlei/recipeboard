Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Blend the egg and the almond flavoring into the creamed butter and sugar. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Blend the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Fold the pineapple tidbits and coconut flakes into the dough. Drop teaspoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
The are delicious just as the are. My customers love them. Bea I made some additions, and hopefully the GKids will love them! Added 20 ozs. Of Pineapple tidbits and 2/3 C. Chopped Almonds and 1/2 C. Rice Krispies! At 12 minutes, out of the oven, they had a great Stand-Up appearance, and I believe Presentation is Key! Oh, and of course, I prayed and added full Cup Love I  baked the first 6 to see how they taste. I couldn't taste the pineapple or coconut so I added more pineapple in and coconut sprinkled on top with sugar for the second test. Upon tasting them I added more pineapple, coconut and dried cranberries. Then I could taste the pineapple a little more and I just love cranberries. I wont make this recipe again but thanks for sharing. These are very cake-like, and bland.  They would be great for whoopie pies perhaps, but the pineapple and coconut are lost in dough.  Not something I would do again, but it did sound good. The are delicious just as the are. My customers love them. Bea
