Easy and so good! Great to make with other mini pies and let everyone try something different! Pretty tasty.  Didn't solidify enough I think, but ate the soft yummy-ness all the same.  Might try with different crusts too (to make for my fall wedding), but graham crust is nice, and awesome to be able to buy pre-made. Easy and so good!  Great to make with other mini pies and let everyone try something different!
