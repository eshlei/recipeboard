This was good. I like the eel sauce at my local sushi bar, it is thicker than this recipe, so I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. It was perfect. Easy and terrific Very simple, very tasty. Sprinkled some scallions for a finisher...love me some scallions! All in all a deceptively simple yet toothsome sauce. Made this tonight...absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and came out perfectly. Definitely needs to be allowed to thicken up while cooling...put it in the refrigerator and it is just the right consistency. Tasty. Great simple tasty sauce.Too thin: You didn't cook it long enough.  When it starts getting lots of bubbles, you are almost there.Too thick:  You cooked it too long.  It will thicken up more as it cools. Cooked it wayyyyyy too long ðŸ¥² became a hard messy mess but it smelt amazing, canâ€™t wait to try it again! I've just made this and it's really thick so I'm wondering if the people that said it was thin had the heat turned up enough?  Mine was really bubbly and went a light shade of brown, once it cooled it was so thick I've had to add more soy sauce.  Will try taste test tomorrow when I make sushi....
