Combine flour, sugar, oil, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add 1 cup of water and start kneading. Continue kneading and adding water until you get an even dough that is very slightly sticky. Knead a further 10 minutes, or longer if you have the time and patience. Cover dough and let rise in a warm area until it has doubled in volume, about 1 hour. (The dough can be baked when it has doubled its volume). Have a few longish sticks or branches ready, about the thickness of a hotdog. Tear off a fistful of dough, roll it into a ball, then flatten it into a 4-inch round. Roll the dough around the end of the stick, so the edges will overlap. Put the dough end of the stick in the campfire. Try to find a hot area that is not actually burning. Cook, turning every so often, until the bread is dark on the outside and slides easily off the stick, about 10 minutes.
