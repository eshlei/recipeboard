On a 6-quart Instant Pot, select the Saute setting. Heat the oil. Add the sausage and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Press Cancel. Add the onion, garlic, beans, Italian seasoning, and Swanson Chicken Broth. Lock the lid and close the pressure release valve. Pressure cook on High pressure, setting the timer to 3 minutes (timer will begin counting down once pressure is reached- it takes about 10 minutes). When done, press Cancel and use the quick-release method to release the pressure. Stir in the kale and let stand for 5 minutes. Season to taste and sprinkle with the cheese.
This was delicious, I used 1pound of regular Italian sausage and added 1 more cup of chicken Broth. I will definitely make this again.
