This was very good. We don't have a grill yet so I seared these on the stove-top with the lid. Got a good crust on the steak and the garlic was tasty. To save on fat I used low-fat marg. I will definitely make this again. I loved it, I added a teaspoon of hot Hungarian paprika to give it a smokey taste. It turned out really good. Yummy! I made the recipe exactly the way it is written.Then I "beefed" it up a bit by adding a little mustard seed,and served it with my favorite country side-dishes.There are many ingredients that may be added to this recipe, as well as many side-dishes,but remember,I used the the recipe ðŸ’¯ exactly as it is the first time I made the "Sirloin Steak with Garlic-Butter.Enjoy!* I made this as a treat dinner after work I added garlic paste and a little bit of seeded mustard to melted butter and drizzled over medium rare steak, boiled potatoes and veg. Chefs kiss ðŸ¤Œ I did not use garlic powder; my instinct told me it would be too garlicky. For the two of us I had 2 8-ounce sirloin steaks. I don't measure things. I do what I think is best. I melted a piece of butter, crushed a large clove of garlic, simmered on low heat for about 20 minutes. When steaks were done, I brushed the steaks with the garlic butter. My wife and I both thought it was good. Not too garlicky, but enough. Will do it again the same way. Added shallots. This is a great way to BBQ beef. The butter and garlic lend a differentbut pleasing taste. I prefer steak cooked medium so I added a coupleof minutes to the cooking time. ENJOY
