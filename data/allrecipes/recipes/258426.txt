Who doesn't love super simple and super quick on a busy weeknight? Use any size shrimp you want. I prefer larger shrimp and that is what I had and this recipe worked just fine. I added some sweet paprika for color and that was a nice touch. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. We used less butter and skipped the garlic and it still came out great! I myself is not a big shrimp eater, I actually prepared it for my Jr Chief. My daughter. whom is 10 yrs old and in her learning how to food prep and prepare foods. she said that she love'd it, for it being my first time.. #CoachT #HealthIsWealth Fresh garlic olive oil etc way to go No changes. I put the shrimp over angel-hair pasta. I love the simplicity of this recipe. And it is so quick to prepare. I serve it with yellow rice and it is fantastic! Delicious. I added chopped parsley and two cloves of garlic with a quartered lemon which I placed in the pan in the last few minutes. Served it over long grain rice. So easy. Excellent. I made without salt because I am salt intolerant and used garlic power powder instead of garlic salt. Easy; quick. Add oven baked seasoned salmon and rice from the InstaPot. Easy. Quick. Hmmm... My own canned green beans. Yeah, you guessed it. Easy; quick.We had a gourmet meal in minutes. Good, quick meal with great flavor.  Used Olive Oil, fresh garlic and 1/4 C fresh lemon juice, salt & pepper.  Flash cooked served with ricearoni and it was lovely
