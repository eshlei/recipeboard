Place chilled cold brew concentrate, cream of coconut, almond extract, and ice cream in a blender. Blend all ingredients just enough to mix well, 10 to 15 seconds. Pour into a large glass. Top with whipped cream, sweetened coconut flakes, almond slices, and a maraschino cherry.
This was absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of both coconut AND almond so this was right up my alley. My daughter & husband preferred the Gevalia recipe we tried earlier this month featuring cookies & cream ice cream, bc they are chocoholics. I liked them both equally!

This recipe is great! Very refreshing and just the right amount of sweet! Will  make again!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program. My husband flipped over this delicious coffee drink!  It was sweet, thick, & creamy and had a wonderful blend of flavors from the coconut, vanilla ice cream, and coffee.   This is the perfect dessert or afternoon treat!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.
