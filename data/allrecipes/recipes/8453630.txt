Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic cloves, parsley, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until marinade is smooth, about 20 seconds. Pour marinade into a resealable gallon-sized plastic bag. Add shrimp to the bag and toss to coat with the marinade. Seal bag and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Soak wooden skewers in cold water while shrimp is marinating. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from marinade and thread onto skewers, 5 to 6 shrimp per skewer. Cook the shrimp on the preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes per side.
I marinated as per receipie but took out frying pan, added butter & coconut oil, adjusted spicing and fried; served with spagetti.  A good alternate way of doing schrimp.
