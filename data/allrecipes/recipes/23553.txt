We loved this!! I used half a can of pineapple chunks and its juice instead of peaches and just plain orange juice instead of the mango-orange juice(didn't have any of either ingrediant on hand). Will make many mornings to come. And this is very "basic," you can add/subtract fruits you prefer or have around the house. Added yogurt and mandarin oranges Freeze the fruit. Skip the ice. Was one of the best i have had yet.  I'm not big on smoothies but this one is one i can handle. Very versatile--I also throw in a hand full of fresh spinach. Made this for lunch today, we had a peach that needed to be used and all the other ingredients! Threw everything in the blender and it's delicious. I added a couple of scoops of vanilla flavored protein since we were having it as a meal replacement. Thank you for the excellent smoothie! I added a banana.  Liked it but will continue to try adding other fruits.  This was my first ever smoothie. I'm hooked. I'm sure I'll be making plenty more. Super easy, super yummy, super fruity! I used V8 Peach Mango juice and it is very healthy. This is the hard way to make a smoothie. We use frozen fruit right from the freezer. No need to add anything else.  You can get an amazing variety of single and mixed fruit. So delicious!
