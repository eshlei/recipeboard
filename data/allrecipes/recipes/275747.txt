Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Divide 1/2 cup butter into 12 to 16 small chunks. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix in butter chunks using a pastry blender. Make a well in the middle of the mixture; pour in buttermilk. Mix until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until just formed together. Cut discs out of dough using a cookie cutter or a cup. Butter both sides of cut biscuit dough with 1/4 cup melted butter. Place biscuits onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with remaining 1/4 cup melted butter while hot. Serve.
