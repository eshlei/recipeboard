This was really good. The only thing that I did differently was to put all the chicken together on skewers and the veggies together on skewers. This way, if the veggies got done first they didn't burn while waiting for the chicken. Delicious, great flavor, will definitely make again. They were tasty.  Marinated chix and veggies for 2 hours.  Added some garlic powder  too.  This was a different marinade option for us and  I would use again. Added squash and cooked extra veggies on grill pan. Only change was adding yellow squash! Delicious! My family and I loved this recipe. We have made it often it was very good as written. Family enjoyed it. May experiment with adding ginger or more garlic or peppers to upp flavor just a bit. This was a good recipe to try.  Very flavorful and we will be cooking this again. A family favorite. Absolutely delicious!
