Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in cold butter. Add buttermilk and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. Place on a floured surface and pat into a circle about 1-inch thick. Cut biscuits using a 3.5-inch biscuit cutter. Arrange 6 biscuits in a circle, 1 in the center, edges touching. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are browned and tops are starting to brown, 11 to 14 minutes.
As a southerner, I consider myself some thing of a biscuit connoisseur! This is a wonderful recipe. I did not have buttermilk so I made sour milk using whole milk and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. That worked wonderfully and these biscuits were divine! The whole family loved them and we will definitely make them again. Highly recommend! Love it Awsome and easy Perfect biscuit recipe. Family loved it! I have made these multiple times and they are requested often!  My husband makes the gravy and make the biscuits. Super easy! These were delightful! Made then at the cottage and they were perfect. I didnâ€™t have buttermilk, so I used milk with vinegar and a few tablespoons of plain yogurt whisked in. I will make these again As a southerner, I consider myself some thing of a biscuit connoisseur! This is a wonderful recipe.
