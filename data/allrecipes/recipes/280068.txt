Add all ingredients to a large punch bowl. Give the punch a stir and serve with cinnamon sugar-rimmed glasses. Let your guests add their own ice, so the punch doesn't become watered down.
Made as written, but cut recipe in half. Delicious and not strong. Next time, I might cut back the ginger beer just a tad, but this was quite excellent! Made as written, but cut recipe in half.

Update: The cranberry infusion directions at the bottom of the Harvest punch recipe takes about 2 weeks time to really infuse the cranberry vodka, but worth the effort to make! I made the cranberry version of the punch for our Christmas dinner and it was DELICIOUS!!
