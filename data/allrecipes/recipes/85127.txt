I read many reviews before I make a recipe. Usually I stick to the recipe to see what it was meant to taste like unless many reviewers suggest 1 or 2 changes. This was pretty good however I added a few changes of my own. In addition to the pepper, I had green I added a small onion, a few baby carrots and one stalk of celery. I was trying to use up some left over vegetables. I cut everything the same size, all diced. I cooked all the veggies together in just a dash of oil. In a bigger frying pan I cooked the potatoes in a little bit of oil and butter to crisp them up a bit then I added the kielbasa. When the potatoes were almost tender I added the lightly sauteed veggies to the pan. I also added a little bit of beef broth to keep it moist and a few dashes of soy sauce. Put the lid on it and let it cook just a tad more to fully cook the potatoes. The only downfall is there just wasn't enough for 3 hungry adults and 1 child. Next time I will make even more. I added half of a large vidalia onion to this recipe because we love vidalia onions.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much I will make it again. Everything burned. I will reduce to low heat and shorten cooking time next time Added onion My boys really liked this recipe! (I did tweak it a bit) I‚Äôm surprised it doesn‚Äôt say to add salt and pepper but I added some. Recipe was great but the timing is off since the potatoes took so long to cook through. Other than that I love it! üòç I made it like it said except I added onion powder; my family doesn't like onions like I do and also added minced garlic. I added jalape√±o peppers.
