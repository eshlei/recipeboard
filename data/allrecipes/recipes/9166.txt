I fixed this for Thanksgiving to take to my parents. My Grandma (85yo) has been wanting the recipe since then, She states this is the best she has had. She is from the country and I remember visiting when she made everything from scratch, her "canned" veggies etc.. were from a mason jar, butter was from a churn, ah to go back in time. Well, if she said it is the best, then it must be!!!! This is like my Mom’s recipe only there was one can of corn as well to add a little consistency. We’ve had a similar family recipe for decades but with some extras (celery, onion, cheese, milk, butter) and more crackers and eggs.  The first question asked at family get togethers is “Who’s bringing the scalloped corn?”  because it’s mandatory. My mom's version used 1 can each drained whole kernel corn and creamed style corn, 2 eggs, 1 T cornstarch, 1/4c milk, 4 T melted butter. Always use Ritz type crackers as they just taste better! One sleeve crushed into fine crumbs with about a fourth added to the mixture and the rest spread over the top. Bake at 375° for 30-45 minutes. This has been in our family for decades.
