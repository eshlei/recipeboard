Stir together soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Pour soy sauce mixture over wings and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour chicken wings and marinade into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until thoroughly hot, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 15 more minutes. Serve hot.
I like the ingredients but I thought it needed a little bit more to it. So I also added ginger powder, kechup and fresh garlic. My husband loved it and even my 3 year old ate his. Of course as usual I made and sampled this dire recipe. Far, far too much sugar. 1 tsp is quite enough. 1.5 'cups' soy quite sufficient, if not less. Would not really bother again, very sadly. Additionally extremely salty. Great flavor, but couldn't get crispy skin.  Next time I will pour off most of marinade before baking and/or try finishing on the grill.  Definitely worth a second try! So awesome tasting ! I make these all the time. The taste is incredible ! Hubby and I did not care for these at all.  Tasted like chicken  dipped in soy sauce. Luckily a cut the recipe in half ok
