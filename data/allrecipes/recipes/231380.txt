This recipe makes fabulous turkey meatballs. I cut down the salt by half, used bread crumbs instead of butter crackers and sauteed the onion and garlic. Cooked the meatballs in a frying pan. Placed meatballs in a baking dish close to one another and covered with sauce. Broiled until sauce bubbled for a couple of minutes. My first attempt at turkey meatloaf.  Simple, easy prep, delicious! Served with cheesy rice & broccoli and pea salad. used bread crumbs and 2 eggs. Was good but a little  on the mushy side. This meatloaf is moist and tasty. The recipe is easy to follow. I finally found a way to prepare ground turkey and actually like it! To start, I used saltine crackers (thatâ€™s what I had readily available). I then season my ground turkey with what the recipe calls for along with my own touch of: 1 packet of onion soup mix, all-purpose seasoning, and garlic salt with parsley. I eyeballed it. I was skeptical about adding milk but I know baking is a science so I added it; I believe the milk helps it maintain moisture during the cooking process. I also did the glaze as listed. This recipe was easy and delicious! Thank you!!! I didn't have any "round crackers," so I used Panko crumbs and it was still excellent! Turkey Meatloaf  is usually very bland, not this one, absolutely love it !!!! I modified a couple of things but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I sauteed my onion, till slightly golden with no seasoning, then added garlic in a  cleared out spot in the middle of a pan, till golden. Evenly mixed the garlic and onion then placed on a paper towel to drain off oil. I followed the meatloaf part exactly adding my sauteed onion and garlic. The sauce I used 1/2 of 1/8 a cup of brown sugar (1/4 of what this recipe called for) I used 1.5 tbsp of Worcestershire and a couple of dashes of  hot sauce. The family loved the recipe. This recipe is very forgiving.  If you don't have crackers, bread crumbs works great too!  Always a family favorite!
