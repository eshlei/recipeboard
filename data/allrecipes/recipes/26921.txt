RECIPE UPDATEI'm the author of this recipe and I wanted to make a few updates. I now use cumin instead of the black pepper. You want 2 cloves of garlic overall. To adjust the texture between creamy and more solid (which is very good also) vary the amount of liquid you drain from the can. The more liquid the creamier, but lately I've been draining all of the can except for 1/2 cup. I now use 3 large tablespoons of Tahini instead of 2. I also take the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and add it gradually as the blending occurs. Peanut Butter is no substitute for Tahini! If you're using peanut butter, you're not eating real hummus. Find it at an international food store Super easy to make. I used a mini food processor, not my blender. The taste was great. I'm going to make it often. You can add to it when serving with some flavors if you want. I used some chili crisp to make it spicy when I craved a bit of heat. I'm going to try some other ideas as they come to me. But the base hummus is great without anything added. IT  IS 100% VEGAN.  I USED LESS LIQUID (1/2 CUP),  I USED 3 LARGE TBL OF TAHINI (INSTEAD OF THREE THAT JUST LOOK LIKE A LOT FOR ME)  1/2 TSP  SALT AND GRADUALLY ADD IT AS THE BLENDING OCCURS, I USED LESS LEMON JUICE (1 TBL SO IT WON'T TASTE SO/TOO MUCH LIKE LEMONS.  I MADE IT TWICE . THE SECOND TIME WITH WOW BUTTER (NOT PEANUT BUTTER)  IT TURN OUT OKAY.  FOR ME BOTH WAYS ARE OKAY. FOR THOSE WHO MADE IT WITH 1 TSP SALT (IN MY OPINION ) IT SEEM LIKE  TOO MUCH SALT SO I USED 1/2 TSP.  IT DIDN'T TASTE TO SALTY EITHER. I made exactly as the recipe modifications.  Wonderful!  I used my food processor instead of my blender.  No more store bought Hummus! Loved it! I will use my food processor next time, difficult scraping down the blender to get every drop out. I didn't have tahini so i substituted with a teaspoon of peanut butter and a splash of sesame oil. Loved the recipe update üëèüèºüëèüèºI added black pepper and Cumin!!Needed one more clove of garlic for my taste.HOWEVER it IS ALSO good just the way the updated recipe states!!Try that first. üòä.Thank you, ROYHOBBS Easy and delicious Super easy and delicious. I added extra roasted garlic to mine I mix this in a food processor for a full 5 minutes. This gives a really smooth consistancy. This hummus gets high praise every time I serve it.
