https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8516197/citrus-and-pomegranate-salad/
Peel grapefruits, oranges, and tangerines with a serrated edge knife, being careful to remove the white pith. Slice all citrus fruit crossways and remove any seeds. Evenly distribute slices amongst 4 salad plates. Sprinkle pomegranate arils evenly over each salad. Stir together sour cream and undiluted lemonade concentrate in a small bowl for the dressing until smooth. Drizzle dressing over each salad. Garnish with mint sprigs.
Absolutely beautiful presentation. Must love citrus.
