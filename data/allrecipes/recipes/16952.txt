The Best Banana Bread
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16952/the-best-banana-bread/
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Beat sugar and margarine in a bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, then bananas. Add flour and baking soda, stirring just until combined. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the pan and let cool. Store in the refrigerator or freeze.
This was exactly what I was looking for! I had 3 overripe bananas that I was getting ready to throw out, instead the light bulb went off to look on Allrecipes for an easy banana bread recipe. I chose this one based on the reviews and the simplicity of the ingredients. The only slight changes I made was I used butter instead of margarine, switched the white sugar to half white and half brown, and cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. I also threw in 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon. It turned out perfect in 45 min. (an hour would have dried the bread out) and it is dense and moist like banana bread should be! Thanks Libby, I will probably make this weekly with my leftover bananas! I followed others advice and added salt, vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts. I made 12 muffins that I baked for about 25 minutes. Delicious. So yummy!! ðŸ¤¤ I also used butter and happened to accidentally add half the flour before the banana and eggs. Still all turned out delicious. Thank you! Been making this for years, I always get compliments on it. I've even reduced the sugar to a 1/2 cup and adding a little vanilla, and it's just as delicious. Deeeeelicious!!! This is very tasty!  I like the cake type banana bread.  I changed the butter to 1/4 cup and added  1/4 Cup sour cream.  I also added 1 teaspoon of baking powder.   It raised nicely.
