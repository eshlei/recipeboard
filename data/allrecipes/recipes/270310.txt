This is really good, and quick to make, assuming your meatballs are made ahead of time. "20 meatballs" is kind of vague as it doesn't really indicate size - I ended up using 1 pound of ground turkey to make the meatballs. I do prefer smaller meatballs in my Italian Wedding Soup, so I ended up with about 50 meatballs. Not sure what size was intended? I used the "My Italian Turkey Meatballs" recipe from this site. The only change I made was to use regular broth (as opposed to low sodium) and it tasted perfect. The cook times were spot on. This makes 4 HUGE servings. You could easily get 6. Looking forward to leftovers! I added a lot more meatballs, but I would stick to the amount of pasta next time, instead of adding a bit more like I did. I also added half the spinach instead of all 6 oz, which is a bit much for my family. It was a huge hit with my family. The only thing I did was use frozen, premade Italian meatballs purchased from the freezer section of the store.  I would serve this to guests as well as take it as a meal, with a salad and rolls to someone recovering from surgery, having a baby, etc... Yummy!  A really great recipe!! It was delicious. I made it twice now. I made this with the new insta pot I got for christmas. really tasty good flavors. it was super easy to make and follow. my family came back for seconds and even thirds! I will be keeping this in my winter soup rotations Love this, added a little Oregano and Coriander I loved this! Great recipe! Added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and a little Cumin.
