Combine balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard, garlic, oregano, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Turn the food processor on; pour olive oil in a steady stream into balsamic vinegar mixture until salad dressing is thick and creamy.
made it as written. Usually I modify recipies. This is spot on! Blended it in a bullet blender. Make sure to chop the garlic first. Topped salad with feta and olives-made with lemon greek chicken-great together! Perfect blend of balsamic, honey, and Dijon. I used fresh oregano and doubled the amount called for, since it was fresh. This is delish! Easy Peezy! Love it! It's a bit thick though... This is my new favorite salad dressing.  Thanks for submitting! I've made this several times just as written. No need for changes. The dressing was delicious.  It stores well. I tried to deviate with a blackberry ginger infused balsamic and blackberry preserves instead of honey, not as good as the original. My new go to dressing!! Good as is Delicious and SO easy to make!  This will be my new," go to," salad Dressing! Excellent! Thank you!
