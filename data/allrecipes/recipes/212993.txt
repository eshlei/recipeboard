Pochero
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212993/pochero/
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; fry plantains and potatoes in hot oil until crisp on the outside, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside, reserving the oil in the pot. Cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chicken and chorizo; season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Pour enough water over the chicken to cover completely; bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook another 10 minutes. Stir the plantains, potatoes, garbanzo beans, and cabbage into the mixture. Cook covered until the cabbage is wilted and everything is hot, about 5 minutes more. Serve hot.
This was a special meal growing up. My mom would usually add chunks of boneless pork ribs stewed up with the chicken until soft. Hmmm....delicious! Chicken was nice and tender.  I expected the plantain to taste sweeter.  It taste like potato. This was a special meal growing up.  My mom would usually add chunks of boneless pork ribs stewed up with the chicken until soft. Hmmm....delicious! Absolutely delicious!!!  Not being a major meat eater I used less chicken; bad move!  I totally should have used the 4lbs - and I should have doubled the amount of chorizo as well.
