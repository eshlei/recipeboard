Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork)
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232681/char-siu-chinese-bbq-pork/
Gather all ingredients. otdash Meredith Food Studio Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight. otdash Meredith Food Studio When ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Set aside the remaining marinade for basting. Rake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for indirect cooking. Cook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes or longer. otdash Meredith Food Studio Serve hot and enjoy!

I like this recipe and have made it three times, with modifications the second and third time. Some observations: Chinese use pork butt for Char Siu because we love the fat and it really is part and parcel to the authentic dish. That said, I used tenderloin the first time, pork sirloin roast the second, and pork shoulder the last. The latter/fatter cut was better in flavor and juiciness, but of course, less healthy.I do like pretty red colored char siu but against my better judgement, I used the full 2 tablespoons of food color which was huge overkill. I went with 1 tablespoon the second time and it was still way too much and stained my cutting board. Food coloring is terrible for our bodies so cut it way back, or not at all, or as suggested, substitute red bean paste or boil down some beets if you want it red. I also like five spice, but take care how much you use. It will overpower all other ingredients. I suggest 1/2 teaspoon or less.Reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade for non-cross contaminated basting before you bag up the meat, and marinate it no less than overnight. It needs to be in the soup that long to penetrate. Don't cook it for an hour or you'll overcook. Use a thermometer and pull it at 145 degrees and let it rest. The water pan is a good suggestion if you are using leaner cuts. A whole butt roast makes a lot, so I portion it up and freeze pieces for later use. I just made Char Siu, doufu, fan (BBQ pork tofu over rice) using bean paste as the main seasoning f um... ketchup ?????tenderloin, Char Siu is from pork butt or shoulder I love Chinese BBQ Pork when we go to restaurants. That is why I tried this recipe.  My husband absolutely loved it and he has never been a fan.  Could not find Chinese rice wine so I used Pinot Grigio. We will definitely be making this again. Came out perfect and so delicious. Cook the raw marinade gently to reduce it & drizzle over your pork/noodles/stir fry/rice/etc..SO much Sugar-I added Tabasco to cut through the sweetness (other hot sauces are available) Delicious! Followed exact recipe including optional 5-spice seasoning. Did overnight marinade and outside grill on high with 4-minute sear for grill marks and then indirect heat with water pan. I used optional red food color (only 1/2 t) rather than red bean curd. Added sesame seeds. Served w/ vegetable fried rice. Meat was incredibly fork tender, sweet and sticky. Was best version I’ve ever had. Lots of great feedback.. Well so far, I was hungry when I looked this up, tasted the sauce and decided to marinate 1/2 and stir fry the other, mixed it with sugar snap peas, green onions and used sesame oil to fry it in, when I was done, I added a little extra sauce and it was great just like that I have yet to cook what is marinating.  I think this is my new go to pork roast recipe :) Excellent!!! We slow cooked using Pork Tenderloins on the gas grill. Served with Jasmin rice and 'Chinese Buffet' Green Beans. Only modification was to the Green beans, we only used 1/2 of the recommended sugar. Good recipe. But do not baste with a marinade used for raw meat. Make up extra and set to the side. Or cook the remaining sauce from the bag. Place in saucepan with 1/2c of water and reduce. I made this recipe years ago. My mom would take us to a store called Crown and I've never forgotten that flavor. Can't wait to make it again 😛 As a Chinese, it tasted just like home.😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡
