Cut celery into small pieces and stick a piece of celery into the middle of each peeled mandarin orange.
What a cute healthy treat.  My students loved theses. I have made many times, love them I have done with mandrins as well. This was so darned complicated!!  I toiled for hours and had to shop for all of the ingredients at various specialty stores; but it was worth it to see the delight in the children's eyes.  (JK. pretty cute idea) Made them for a Halloween grab and go breakfast buffet at work and they were a hit! People appreciated the healthy option and not having to peel the fruit. I was picky about getting the strings off and separated the sections a bit to emphasize the creases. Took a little time, but they were really cute! Really cute, simple, and healthy
