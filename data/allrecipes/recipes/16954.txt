Excellent, easy recipe. I rinse the rice in cold water, so I don't have to wait. I also decreased the pepper because it's got a little too much zip. sounds great, easy recipe, but needs more flavor My wife and I loved this dish and will do it again. It had great flavors and I feel it's better than takeout. However, I followed the video as some of the written instructions did not make sense to me. I used a large skillet on high heat and spread the rice out and got a great result with regards to the crispy rice. I cooked it by adding frozen peas and carrots, plus canned bean sprouts. I used two eggs in this recipe. Great dish for fried rice or any other protein. Thanks for the recipe! This was very good. I also added some frozen veggies and just a few red pepper flakes, bit of salt and bit of minced garlic but add what you want or donâ€™t. We enjoyed this very much. Easy recipe to follow and quick to prepare and cook. I added red peppers, chopped mushrooms, chilli flakes and sprinkled spring onions on top.... I also used 1 tablespoon of light soy and 1 of dark.
