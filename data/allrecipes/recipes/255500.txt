Leftover Halloween Candy Cookies

Melt candy bars, sugar, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at at time, until smooth. Mix in flour and baking soda to create a sticky dough. Chill dough in the refrigerator until it can be easily scooped, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Roll 1 1/2 teaspoonful of dough into balls. Place onto prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven until brown and fluffy, 10 to 12 minutes.
Be sure to use a double boiler to melt the candy bars. I almost used a saucepan on direct heat, and almost had a burnt on disaster! While leftover Halloween candy doesn't tend to be a normal occurrence in our house, I can imagine wanting to look for a way to use it up should the situation arise.  I made these cookies with Kit Kat bars and wasn't terribly impressed.  They were edible but not really enjoyable.  The texture was edible but dry, the flavor wasn't spectacular.  Possibly using a candy bar with more moisture (something with caramel or nougat?) might remedy the issue.  All in all I can think of a lot things I'd rather do with a candy bar.
