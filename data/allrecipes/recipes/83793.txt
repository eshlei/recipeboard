Very nice recipe with great flavor. Made the first time and it was wonderful. Made it the second time with fresh squeezed orange juice as I was out of lemon juice. Even better!!! This is a delicious recipe for baked or grilled chicken, I didnâ€™t have the liquid smoke so I added 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce instead and it turned out wonderful- definitely a keeper! My husband doesn't like chicken, but he likes this. Fabulous! I didn't change a thing. Put it on top of caesar salad and my family loved it! This is a marinade I use on repeat, I've been using this for years. Simple, easy, great flavors. I don't use the liquid smoke. Very easy and left the chicken wet moist The marinade came out great.  My wife (who is very particular) loved it so it's in the family favorite box now.  The low sodium soy sauce was perfect, not too salty. It was tasty.  Improvised a little on the ingredients by necessity.  Will get the right ingredients and cook it again. Tried it; loved it and shared it with friends and its my go-to recipe for all dinners and get togethers!!  Did not use the amount of Olive Oil as 2/3 cup was excessive; used 1/4 cup the next time and it was perfect. Not added salt either.
