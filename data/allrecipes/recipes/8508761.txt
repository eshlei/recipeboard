Combine avocado, sour cream, mayonnaise, water, lime juice, ranch seasoning, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place the chicken in a bowl. Add olive oil and fajita seasoning. Toss until evenly combined. Prepare a grill over medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Add chicken and corn. Grill, turning once, until corn is tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a cutting board. Divide romaine, tomatoes, black beans, and onions between two serving plates. Cut corn off the cob; divide between the two plates. Slice chicken breast; divide between the 2 plates. Drizzle each salad with avocado dressing to serve.
My husband and I loved this recipe. I would say my favorite part of the recipe was the creamy avocado ranch dressing. I did have to add more water to thin out the salad dressing as it was too thick even to spoon on the dressing. This recipe is easy to do, and quite tasty.  I did everything to the letter except the following:1. I brined the chicken breasts in salt, water, peppercorns and a bay leaf.  This kept them juicy and tender off the grill.2.  I didn't have an avocado so I opened one of those single-serve spicy guac snack packs.  This gave the dressing a nice kick.The meal came out delicious and ideal for summer time.
