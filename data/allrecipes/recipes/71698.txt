This was a great recipe, with some recommendations. I added a little more honey, less sesame oil(would use a tablespoon or less), definitely used mirin, soy sauce(low sodium - it's what I have) and rice wine vinegar. Some wasabi paste added to the marinade and dipping sauce is a must for some zip. I cut the steaks so that they are about 1/2 to 3/4" thick and sear for about 40 seconds. If they are thicker they burn before they even cook a little - I like them pink, not red in the middle. Preheat cast iron, but be sure to turn down the head to medium high or you will have smoke and smoke alarms going off. Sesame Seeds - don't bother - I've tried it both ways, they don't add much, and they pop all over the place when you sear the steaks and make a mess. ( I lightly toasted them first - so if you have to have them - toast them, then dip the seared steaks just before you serve, and save yourself a lot of clean up. I served with plain rice or long grain and wild rice. Great to sop up the dipping sauce. Iâ€™ve made this dish many times and love it. I saw one review suggesting cutting the tuna fillets into flatter cuts and omitting the sesame seeds. Different strokes for different folks. I have no difficulty in controlling the doneness of the fish cooking it in my ancient cast iron skillet. Of course, my desired degree of doneness is in the range of rare to medium rare. I have never had a problem with the imbedded sesame seeds popping. I will say that I back off the soy a bit. I find the soy can overwhelm the flavor of the tuna if one is not careful. To get the full impact of the dish donâ€™t overcook the fish. It is difficult to raise 'rare' fish to my lips, but had I cooked it any longer it would be dry and not nearly as good.  So YES keep it pink it is DELICIOUS! Followed directions to a tee, my frying pan caught on fire Absolutely delectable! Hubby caught gulf-fresh blackfin, and this recipe rocked our tastebuds!
