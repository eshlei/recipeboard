https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8459985/chicken-ramen-noodle-soup-with-honey-sriracha-crackers/
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes. Stir in cooked chicken and ramen noodles. Simmer, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with lime zest and, if you like, additional basil and oregano leaves, and serve with Honey-Sriracha Crackers.
Did this recipe in reverse; oyster crackers first, ramen second - and did the celery/carrot/onion/garlic prep work while the crackers cooked. My oven? I should have checked these 5-6 min in. I checked seconds before the 8 minute timer/mark and a few were charred - I’m guessing due to the honey. I stirred and removed from the oven to cool. Again, and maybe because these were a tad over cooked, only thought these were so-so. To me, limited enhancement to this recipe. The ramen however? Really good!! Only change was using rotisserie chicken and added a cube of Trader Joe’s frozen, minced ginger instead of fresh. The rest? As written and this was really good! Kinda like a cheater recipe for chicken noodle soup! Minus the Siracha oyster crackers - I would make this again! Thank you thehungryscientist!! Made as directed with the exception of using dried oregano and basil as I did not have fresh.  I also added the seasoning packets to the soup.  My daughter who is not afraid to offer criticism really enjoyed it and said it gets 5 stars.  That does not happen often. Her only suggestion is to use more broth.  She walked into the kitchen as I was cooking the sauce for the crackers and asked what smelled so good.  Thanks for sharing.
