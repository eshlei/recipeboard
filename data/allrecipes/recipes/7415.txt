Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottoms of two 9x13-inch glass baking dishes. To make the cakes: Mix chocolate cake mix, 1 ¼ cups water, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 3 eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Pour into one of the prepared baking dishes. Mix white cake mix, 1 cup water, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 3 egg whites in another large bowl on medium speed with clean beaters until well combined. Pour into the second prepared baking dish. Bake cakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes for the chocolate cake and 29 to 34 minutes for the white cake. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. While the cakes are baking, make the pudding: Whisk cold milk and pudding mix together in a large bowl for 2 minutes. Refrigerate until needed. Crumble cookies in small batches in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl often. Place 1/4 cup crumbs into a small bowl; stir in food coloring until crumbs are green. Set remaining crumbs aside. Unwrap candy rolls. Line the kitty litter box with the liner. Crumble cooled cakes into a large bowl. Add 1/2 of the uncolored cookie crumbs and some chilled pudding; toss to blend, adding more pudding as needed until mixture is moist but not soggy. Pour mixture into the kitty litter box. Microwave 1/2 of the candy rolls in a microwave-safe dish until soft, 30 to 60 seconds. Shape the ends so they are no longer blunt, then curve the candies slightly. Bury candies randomly in the litter box and sprinkle with 1/2 of the remaining uncolored cookie crumbs. Sprinkle a few green crumbs over top. Microwave 3 to 4 candies until almost melted. Place them on top of the cake and sprinkle some green crumbs over top. Microwave remaining candies until soft, then shape as in Step 9. Arrange all but one candy randomly over the cake, then sprinkle with remaining uncolored crumbs. Hang the remaining candy over one side of the litter box and sprinkle remaining green crumbs over top. Serve cake with the kitty litter scoop.
what a wonderful joke, delicious too!!I've made this twice now.I bought the smallest cat box I could find, and the first time, it barely covered the bottom. The second time I made up 2 vanilla cake mixes and one chocolate and it filled the pan alot better.Also, the second time, I added the pudding before it set and it was alot easier to mix.It was a big hit both times however, got lots of laughs.I would love to meet the twisted mind who first thought it up...genius. I made this for a large preschool kids Halloween party. They loved this cake and all of them ate it. Really fun dessert. I'm  doing this recipe for myGrandchildren...I told their Mom what I was doing & she thought that will be nasty & her cats might see the box & go for it...I tasted the cakes & all put together, It's  a great gag, Thanks! Made this for my coworkers last year.  Had them fooled since I am a Crazy Cat Lady!  They wouldn't eat it until I did.  It was terrific!  Thanks for the recipe! Loved it! Turned out great. I would recommend this to make mixing easier: divide each chocolate & white cake into thirds, then crumble into 3 bowls. I have large mixing bowls and struggled to mix everything together into two bowls when adding the pudding. Flavor is good without being too sweet. Instead of buying a litter box for this, I got a disposable aluminum pan 13 x 9 in x 4 inches deep. Litter scooper brings it together, got from the dollar store & washed before placing. Very realistic.    way to go Jeanne 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Happy Birthday Cal Most people where too grossed out  to eat it but the people that did loved it. I used Ghirardelli brownies . I let them cool overnight then scooped some out and shaped them like cat turds. I rolled them in the crushed golden oreos and buried some of them. This was a hit!I made cakes, grated cookies ahead of time and assembled day of party.Making another for a party tonight!Hint: I assembled, including tootsie,  day of party and refrigerated cake until needed. Total refrigerator time about 4 hours.   The candy looked wet and lightened in color so for tonight’s cake, I’ll add candy just before needed so color is  darker.I used a foil pan and purchased scoop! Worked perfectly.My daughter suggested getting a skeleton cat for next year!!!   Wish she suggested it earlier.  Would have been the perfect touch! Omg - Read the review by worldsbestchef. Lol x 10.But, seriously, I can’t wait to make this again for an upcoming party. A tiktok person also used marshmallow fluff dipped in the cake and cookie crumbs for the “urine clumps.” Looked so good. The only thing I changed is I didn't use Tootsie rolls. I have a cast iron corn on the cob pan. I make brownies in that and lay around the top of the cake and in the cake. 🤣🤭
