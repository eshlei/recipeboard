Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil in the cooker. Add sausage and cook until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion and garlic; cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Add potatoes and chicken broth. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure and set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir kale into the cooker. Select Saute function. Cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Stir in half-and-half. Turn off the cooker and serve.
Very easy recipe. We omitted salt. There's plenty in the sausage and we didn't miss it. We also used spinach instead of kale and evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. My husband wants this to make a regular meal for us! Excellent soup! Have person in house with congestive heart failure so on next to no salt diet. With that in mind, I used no salt chicken stock and omitted the 1/2tsp salt. Used spinach instead of kale. Taste was positively craveable, especially in a soup that didn't simmer all day. One of my favorite comfort foods to make. It's so easy ! Loved it just prefer cheese filled noodles instead but husband loves potatoes so 💁‍♀️ used spinach instead of kale. Don’t like kale. A little bland. Sprinkled some parmesan on top after serving. I will add canellini beans next time as others suggested. I added a can of white kidney beans and substituted spinach for the kale and used evaporated milk instead of the half and half.Served with grated grana padano on top. Yummy. This recipe is a great crowd pleaser. I have made it several times and  always receive multiple compliments. I also add a can of cannellini beans and I really liked the addition. Epic Excellent recipe! Turned out equal to or better than the one at the Olive Garden. Simple to make and so delicious. My go to on rainy days! Easy and quick to make 🤤
