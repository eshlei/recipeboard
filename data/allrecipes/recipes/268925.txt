Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust. Combine evaporated milk, pumpkin, sugar, eggs, maple syrup, maple extract, cinnamon, salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a bowl. Mix until well blended using an electric mixer. Pour into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted into the pie comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
My husband raved about this pie.  He told me twice to make sure I put this into my favorites.  I took it to Thanksgiving, but there was a run on pumpkin pies this year.  That's ok as we were able to bring it home and enjoy most of it here.  It just looks like a regular pumpkin pie, but its not. So delicious! I used 1/2 cup of sugar and extra 1/2 tsp maple bourbon syrup. No maple extract This is a nice twist on the usual pumpkin pie.  I used Vermont Grade B maple syrup which I think is best for baking.  The maple flavor shines through but does not overpower the pumpkin flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it.
