Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Spread pumpkin seeds onto the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with salt, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and oregano; toss to coat evenly. Bake seeds in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; stir seeds. Return to oven and bake until seeds are toasted, about 15 more minutes.
Great recipe. I added honey and lime juice to balance it all out. Delicious! These were great!  Will definitely make again next season.  a different take, if you like a little spicy. I loved this recipe! I have roasted pumpkin seeds annually for years, but always the same way. This year I decided to try something new! Great flavor! I used a nonstick pan so I opted out for the oil and be very careful with how much salt you add because mine turned out a tad bit salty but they're still so good! I will use this recipe again and I just loved it so much. Okay so I changed it up a little. I used butter instead of cooking spray  and added Worcestire. Also I didn't measure the spices and cooked them much longer (40min) at 300 bc another recipe I was making simultaneously called for the lower temp. Still the flavor was phenomenal.  The kids didn't care for it but I love it. Near perfect!  A bit heavy on the cumin and they were too spicy for the kids due to the cayenne.  I ended up mixing them with a sweet cinnamon pumpkin recipe from this site and the result was phenomenal!  Sweet, spicy, salty....perfect!
