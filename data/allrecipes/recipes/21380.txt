https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21380/slow-cooker-kielbasa-and-beer/
Combine kielbasa, sauerkraut, and beer in a slow cooker. Cook on Low until kielbasa is tender and plump, 5 to 6 hours.
This is a 4-star recipe ONLY if you do the following: Add 1/2 cup of honey mustard, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 2 Bottles of Sam Adams beer, any saurkraut and polska kielbasa PEELED! Eat alone or put on a fresh hard roll. If you only use beer, you'll know you're missing something! I make this all the time this way. So easy! Added caraway seeds. this is one of our family's favorite dinner. Have made it for potlucks too! I sautÃ© my Kielbasa first, then do rest of recipe. I also add caraway seeds, last 20 minutes before finished. gives it a great flavor Add some Bell Peppers and a couple JalapeÃ±os hot ones just TWO or to your desire .   ðŸ˜…   ðŸ¤Œ   Enjoyed it immensely, my wife made it every time we went to her sister and brother in lawâ€™s house before weâ€™d go to Gilleyâ€™s club Pasadena, TEXAS . I thought this was easy, fast and flavorful.  I did not slice the kielbasa but left it whole and rinsed my sauerkraut before cooking.   It was done in 4 hours.  I also tried this with hotdogs and would  not recommend hotdogs as they overcook. Thank you so very much!!!!  It was amazing!!!!!!! Simple, but excellent! Cooking the sauerkraut with beer reduced some of the sourness, which I liked. With some Inglehoffer mustard on the plate - I'm good to go! I have made a recipe like this many times.  Iâ€™m not a beer fan, so I substitute  zero sugar ginger ale for the beer.  It adds an tittle sweetness.  It is great over noodles with butter, and some Italian seasonings. This was so easy and so  good!  I added fingerling potatoes, onion and green pepper to the bottom of the crockpot before adding the kielbasa, sauerkraut, and beer! I made it without the beer and the sausage was so tender and juicy. Added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the sauerkraut was mild and delicious.
