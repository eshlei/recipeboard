I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of the soy milk, but cut it down to 2/3 cup. I also froze the banana before using. I added a half scoop of vanilla protein powder as well as a couple tablespoons of almond butter. This is probably the tastiest smoothie I have ever had; I could not even taste the spinach. Thanks for a fantastic base recipe that can easily be modified according to your tastes! Delicious, simple and healthy! Trying these to help in my recovery from surgery. First time I added some Greek yoghurt. Will definitely use this base & play around with different flavours in the future. Used regular milk, added honey, a little plain greek  yogurt,  and cinnamon. So many nutrients in something that tastes like an indulgence! Thick and creamy but no spinach taste! I added beetroot powder, banana, spinach, almond butter, cinnamon and turmeric. It was surprisingly good although quite sweet which was not a bad thing. What did I do wrong? Oh I added cows milk because I didn't have soy milk but it doesn't look green.. anyway how did you make yalls look so good? But it tastes OK I thought it was pretty flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised. Yummy! Used original almondmilk and slightly less frozen spinach than what the recipe calls for. Very basic and simple but I really liked it, it is a great base to add stuff on to probably but I really just like it on its own! I am learning to eat healthier and this is easy, quick and tasty. I did add flaxseed and psyllium and with water as I have a allergy to soy. I might add other fruits also. I didn't take a picture.
