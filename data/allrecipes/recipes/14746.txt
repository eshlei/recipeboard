I also use the golden mushroom soup for this recipe. For a one dish meal, I just put the pork chops in a 9x13 dish, pour in all the ingredients, add potatoes and cover tightly with foil bake at 350 for about 40-45 minutes. Big Hit at my house and really easy when you don't want to cook...which is pretty much every evening. excellent I love the recipe, but no mash or rice or starches with it, please! The family enjoyed it. Makes porkchops a little fun. :) I forgot the garlic salt and I didn't miss it!   After the recipe was complete, I left it on the stove at a very low simmer for about an hour.It was OUTSTANDING!!!!! Was okay but definitely needs some sunshine to it! Fresh garlic? Nutmeg? A sprig of this or that... Tarragon, maybe. Made it with pasta in homemade sauce and fresh veggies. it smells amazing.  I added fresh garlic.  That's the only change.  So easy to make. The pork chops turned out  nice and tender. Next time I will chop the mushrooms to small pieces so they are easier to pick up with the meat.
