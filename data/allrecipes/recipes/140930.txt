Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat pan large enough to hold fillets. Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan, turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate. Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add fillets to the bag, a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly coated. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry fillets in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding, so fillets have room to brown properly. Drain on paper towels.
I personally hate fish of any kind but my boyfriend is a huge fried catfish fan. He said it was the best fried catfish he has ever had! The trick is after you bread the fish let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. This way you wwill not have problems with the breading falling off! Use lemon pepper seasoning in the cornmeal mixture. Add fresh herbs Fried Catfish has got to be one of my favorite go-to meals! I give each patty a generous shaking of Pete's Red Hot and my mouth is in 7th Heaven!  I have even double breaded mine for a super crunchy crust! I used some semolina flour in addition to the corn meal and white flour and also added blackening spices to the flour mix. I didn’t have any buttermilk so I used plain yogurt with the water and a squirt of lemon juice. Turned out very crispy and tasty! I added Fish Fry Seasoning and instead of strips I cut it into nuggets. Very good. Unfortunately I didn’t have tartar sauce, cocktail sauce or ketchup. Panicked found horseradish mustard and turned out to be a very good condiment.
