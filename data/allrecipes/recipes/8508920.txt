I cut the recipe in half and made it in my slow cooker. I served it on buns with provolone cheese. Itâ€™s a spicy sandwich which packs a little bit of heat. Very yummy, delicious and EASY!  Made slow cooker version. So good! Made it in a slow cooker and it was excellent! ? Very easy to make very delicious. I will definitely be making this again. I served it over pastaNancy Great slow-cooker recipe. Spicy, but not too hot. Can eat on bun, tortillas or rice. Always in the rotation!! This looks delicious. But what can I use instead of the ranch seasoning mix? My family doesn't like ranch or ranch flavored anything.
