I make this often with the following changes. Add 1 tsp cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Use only 1 or 2 eggs and 3 tablespoons butter. I bake it in a 9x13 baking dish at 400 degrees for ~23 minutes. Grate nutmeg and dust top with powdered sugar after removing from the oven. My family loves this dish for breakfast, even my picky 2 year old! Often I substitute in up to 1/4 cup wheat germ for 1/4 cup of the flour (1/4 C wheat germ + 3/4 C flour). Sometimes I add a well-mashed banana to the batter. It comes out great every time, with some variation on the texture. Really fantastic! Simple, easy, works every time! Only add for me, but if vanilla paste! Great recipe! Made as is and loved it . Wonderful starter recipe:I added vanilla to the eggs then sliced apples cinnamon and brown sugar then topped off with a handful of granola. Served with whip cream Easy to make and delicious! I half the recipe only because itâ€™s only me. I use powdered sugar and lemon juice to eat it and it is divine! Just used 4 eggs.  Added 3Tbs sugar and 1tsp vanilla as suggested.  I think 3Tbsp butter would have been enough too. Not sure if I need to subtract flour
