Creamed Leeks

Trim the leeks and remove the tough outer leaves. Slice the white and light green part into 1/4-inch rings, put them into a large bowl of water and swish gently to remove any dirt or sand; drain in a colander. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt butter. Add leeks and cook until they are just starting to get tender and lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and saut√© until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir together whipping cream and Dijon mustard and pour into the skillet, stirring until well incorporated. Reduce heat to low and simmer until leeks are tender but still crisp, 6 to 8 minutes (don't overcook). Season with salt and pepper and remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle with nutmeg and Parmesan cheese; serve immediately
I forgot the cheese and nutmeg - but didn't need them. We had with salmon & it was delicious. Easy to do.
