https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/160565/tangy-pomegranate-martini/
Moisten the rim of a chilled martini glass with a twist of lemon. Pour the sugar onto a small plate, and dip the glasses into the sugar. Place the lemon twist in the rimmed glass, and set aside. Pour the vodka, lemon juice, pomegranate juice, and simple syrup into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the rimmed martini glass to serve.
Kickin' martini, not too tart, not too sweet. I muddled a lemon wedge with the simple syrup and ice before adding the vodka and juice. Gives an essential lemon flavor. Thanks for the recipe!! These could be dangerous, I'm on my second one!!  Easy to make & tasty. Iâ€™ve tried other recipes- this recipe is by far the best. A good martini. I skinny it up by using Diet Cranberry/Pomegranate juice. I make my own simple "syrup" out of 2 cups of water + 2 Cups of powdered Splenda -- bring to a boil, boil for a minute and set aside to cool. Refrigerate "syrup" when cool. This is yummy.  There is a nice balance between the sweetness and tang.  I can do without the sugar on the rim. Kickin' martini, not too tart, not too sweet.
