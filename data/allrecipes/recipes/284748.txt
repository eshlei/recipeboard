Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, orange zest, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large mixing bowl. Grate frozen butter into dry ingredients using a box grater. Combine well, incorporating butter into dry ingredients until it looks like a coarse crumble. Stir in cranberries until combined. Combine sour cream, egg, orange juice, and vanilla extract in a small mixing bowl. Mix until smooth. Stir into dry ingredients and combine until dough just holds together and there are no dry ingredients at bottom of bowl; do not overmix. Turn out dough and form into a 10-inch circular mound, pressing flat to about 3/4-inch thickness, and sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. Cut circle into 8 triangles and spread apart slightly on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 17 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
These scones have the perfect amount of orange jest and cranberries. The next time I make these I will put the butter in with the flour mixture in a food processor and save myself the aggravation of grating frozen butter; and instead of spreading the tops with sugar, I will make a little icing to drizzle on the top for added appeal. They are a nice addition to our morning coffee. So sticky I kept adding flour but could not get them solid enough to even cut apart.
