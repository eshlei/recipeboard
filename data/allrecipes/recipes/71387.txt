We loved this! Added lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic salt and basil. May try with some olives next (Italian baked salmon?) I did not make any changes.  I am wanting to try lemon juice.  Love this recipe.  I have made it several times. Added a very thin layer of mayonnaise on the top before the onions, tomatoes & seasoning! YUM! Thanks for this recipe! ðŸ’— Note to Plano_Harry - Thanks! Your recipe took me to great page w/fabulous recipes.BTW - for 50+ yrs our family has made a version of this with salmon, tomatoes, mozz cheese, then the gr onions. Give that one a try. Good recipe, however I topped with lemon juice and some fresh dill with the tomatoes for some added flavor. Delicious! I will give it a 4 for Easy.  "Best" goes to Jacques Pepin for Oven-baked Salmon with Sun-Dried Tomato and Salsa Mayonnaise This is a good basic recipe! I added olive oil and lemon juice to give it more taste. Serves up nice with black rice. Will make again. Quick and easy. Spice it or add what or how you want but do not leave tomatoes out. As they kook, the juices from tomatoes keep salmon moist. It comes out so tender, juicy and very very delicious. A fantastic healthy addition to my diet
