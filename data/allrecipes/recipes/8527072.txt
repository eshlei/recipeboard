Combine mashed potatoes, Cheddar cheese, green onions, bacon bits, and flour in a bowl; stir until combined. Mix in beaten egg. Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Form mixture into 6 patties and set on a baking sheet. Place baking sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes while you preheat the air fryer. Place patties in the air fryer basket in batches, making sure to not overcrowd. Cook undisturbed for 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining patties.
This recipe was delicious and healthy too. I made a crumble with Ritz crackers Italian seasoning, garlic powder, chili powder dehydrated onions and a little shredded cheese. Pinched all the ingredients together until blended and crumbly. I use that instead of flour. I used some of the crumble on the top of the Patty before I bake them. I use two pieces of snipped pre-cooked bacon strips. I didn't use green onion, tho I would have if I had some. Continuedâ€¦â€¦I put them on a pan greased with olive oil instead of in the basket and lightly pressed down a bit . They spread, they were crisp and yummy yummy edges., and since I put some o the ritz  crumble on the tops, so they were nice and crunchy too. Now a favorite family recipe :) I did it to the T and they turned into puff balls and the outer layer was like a skin instead of a crunchâ€¦.ðŸ‘Žboooo The bottom layer stuck to the basket. Lots of melted cheese dripped through the basket. Did taste good, but too much cleanup with the basket. This recipe was delicious and healthy too.
