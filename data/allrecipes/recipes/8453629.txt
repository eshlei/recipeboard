Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Combine cherry tomatoes, mozzarella balls, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and Thai basil in a large mixing bowl; mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Drain pasta and top with cherry tomato mixture.
Loved this! Perfect flavors for a nice light pasta dish that did not feel too heavy. We grilled some chicken and sliced it over the top, which made this a filling entrée! A favorite! We really enjoyed this, light tasty salad. I couldnt find the lemon-infused white balsamic vinegar, so I used white balsamic vinegarm then add about one half teaspoon lemon juice. Great recipe.
