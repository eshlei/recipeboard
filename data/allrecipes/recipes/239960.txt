Gather all ingredients. ana Ennis/Allrecipe Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. ana Ennis/Allrecipe Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky, about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The longer you cook it, the less chunky it will be. ana Ennis/Allrecipe ana Ennis/Allrecipe Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools. ana Ennis/Allrecipe Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.
This is the best way to cook cranberries. There is NO need to add orange, or lemon, or zest, or anything! KISS! (Keep It Simple Stupid) Don't mess with perfection! I made a batch this morning, using a Splenda/sugar blend instead of straight-up sugar. Only been a few hours, but it's gelling like a dream, and tastes great. The perfect combination of sweetness and tartness. Can't wait to try it on the turkey tonight! This is how I always make it....love it ! I love this recipe it is both simple and delicious. Very simple recipe.  I like to add a little orange zest to give a hint of citrus.  On other occasions, I will mince up some fresh jalapeno to add to it for a little heat. Simple and perfect! ❤️ Great, easy recipe.  Thanks, Josef...and you're right.  It's better with a bit of tartness! Love this recipe!  I substituted water for orange juice and added a dash of cinnamon.  Family loves it at Thanksgiving with turkey and at Christmas ham. I like a traditional cranberry sauce and this recipe is perfect.
