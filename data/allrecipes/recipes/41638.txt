Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine avocados, onions, and garlic salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Arrange corn tortillas in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 2 to 5 minutes. Spread avocado mixture on tortillas; garnish with cilantro and sprinkle with pepper sauce.
I loved this recipe, even my strictly carnivorous boyfriend enjoyed it. I brush the outside of the tortillas with a olive oil-lime juice mixture before throwing them in the oven and left them there for a little longer than the recipe called for. I garnished the tacos with some pico de gallo, chili peppers and sour cream. These are so good. I drizzle sweet and sour sauce over the finished product nixing any salsa or taco sauce. it was really quick and very tasty.  good for the DASH diet my husband follows.  I will make this again very soon. Was really good but not enough food for a main dish. Needed more to fill my husband and I up. Plus next time I'll add tomato's and salsa to the top. But so good. i mixed in some lime juice and restaurant style salsa.  EXCELLENT! We loved this recipe!  Made it exactly as the recipe called for and this is now a staple for me family These were delicious. I put my oven on 400 to crisp up the tortillas, and that worked great. I served this with salmon patties. The freshness of the guacamole and cilantro went very well with them! Delicious and simple! The recipe is a good start, but it needs a bit more. I added diced tomatoes to give it more texture, mozarella cheese, and dripped cholula sauce onto the tacos for some great flavor. Didn't have any flavor. Was pretty much guacamole on a tortilla shell. But less flavor.
