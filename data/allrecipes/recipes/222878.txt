I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka in this recipe. For me, I liked it but there was a little too much cream and not enough vodka. I think cut back on the half-n-half by an ounce and up the vodka to an ounce or so then it would be perfect. Very tasty recipe. Made in a big batch and refrigerated. Delicious, but watch out. These sneak up on you! This is the best, most decadent, dessert/drink ever.  It is strong, so be careful! Used Godiva liqueur, vodka, and half and half (no creme de caco).  Add grated chocolate. I substituted Heavy Cream for the Half and Half, covered the top of the drink with whipped cream and shaved a high quality chocolate bar on top. All agreed it was a great drink (even some that don’t normally drink at all)! I added a little more of the alcoholic ingredients  than the recipe called for and it was delicious I used chocolate syrup to decorate glasses. I followed recipe except that I used 1 oz of whipped vodka and only 1 oz of whipping cream. Then I made a chocolate swirl on top with the syrup. This came out fantastically. A wonderfully boozy take on dessert. love the creaminess of the half-n-half. Love, love, love it! Godiva chocolate liqueur is the only way to go! I agree with another review, cut back on the creamer and add slightly more vodka so it isn't quite so sweet. Still a fabulous drink.
