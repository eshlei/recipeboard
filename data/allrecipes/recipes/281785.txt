Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Combine mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, onion, parsley, egg, garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in ziti and 2 cups marinara sauce. Spread 1 cup marinara in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to coat. Pour ziti mixture into the dish; top with remaining 1 cup marinara, and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Remove foil; continue baking until bubbly and cheese browned, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven; let sit 10 minutes before serving.
Phenomenal recipe!  My husband has made this ziti as the meatless option for the Christmas family gathering two years in a row and everyone has to grab a generous scoop along with the meat lasagna we make. So delicious and great as leftovers when there are any.  We've made it as is, no changes at all and can't even think of any necessary. I made this exactly as written (to include using Ziti instead of a gluten free pasta option so I could try it). For the most part my family liked it rating it from 4.5-3.5. Most of their complaints centered on the onions but my pasta loving daughter thought it was too cheesy.
