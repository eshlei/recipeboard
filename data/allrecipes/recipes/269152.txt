Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine red onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika on a sheet pan and toss well to combine. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are softened, about 15 minutes. While vegetables are roasting, combine shrimp, 1 tablespoon olive oil, lemon zest, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Toss to combine. Remove roasted vegetables from the oven and add shrimp to sheet pan, spreading everything out evenly in one layer. Return to oven and bake until shrimp are pink and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.
We really enjoyed this. Made it exactly per recipe and didn't find it bland at all. Looking forward to making it again using an assortment of veggies. We really enjoyed this.  Made it exactly per recipe and didn't find it bland at all.  Looking forward to making it again using an assortment of veggies. I added broccoli and carrots (as shown in the photo), but by the time the shrimp was done the broccoli was charred.  Will make again, but will add the shrimp earlier and spray the pan first as well. I thought it was good.  In light of reviews mentioning it was a bit bland, added soy sauce & sesame oil to the mix for the vegetables & shrimp.  Added broccoli to vegetables, did not add red peppers.  Served over ramen noodles. Needs Soy Sauce.  The leftovers of this dish tasted better with a dash of Soy Sauce (I use the low-sodium varity) This was easy and very good. I added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes to the shrimp and served over angel hair pasta. My wife and I made this recipe for our dinner today. An we enjoyed it very much. Thank You for sharing this recipe with us it was delicious. Just adjusted for 2 and we enjoyed! This was a great dish! I will make again! I used some spices I had on hand but I may add some soy sauce next time.
