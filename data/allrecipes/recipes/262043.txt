https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262043/vegan-korean-kimchi-fried-rice/
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add red onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high and add chopped kimchi and vinegar. Stir in cooked rice, soy sauce, sugar, soy sauce, kimchi brine, and sesame oil. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes; scrape the bottom of the skillet to prevent sticking. Season with salt and pepper.
this is delicious & fairly easy to throw together. just a tip for those cooking this FOR a vegan: honey is generally not considered vegan. i would use regular sugar to be safe. happy eating :) This is a simple and delicious recipe. Once I tried it, I was also able to riff with the flavors to use in potato and ramen dishes. Made this with leftover medium grain white rice and doubled the recipe. That, along with sunny side eggs on top (humanely raised), made a perfect dinner for 2+. It could feed more if also served with a side dish. Absolutely delicious! Boyfriend and I immediately agreed it's a"make again "... and soon. This recipe is going in my regular rotation. It was fast and easy. Perfect weeknight dish. I usually don't like kimchi, but this flavor combination with rice and the sauces coming together really made everything delicious! Definitely healthier than what I usually eat and it definitely tastes how I imagined! I used parsley and 1tbs ketchup also this is delicious & fairly easy to throw together. just a tip for those cooking this FOR a vegan: honey is generally not considered vegan. i would use regular sugar to be safe. happy eating :)
