https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261408/butternut-squash-soup-with-persimmon/
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and bay leaf and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add butternut squash and keep cooking, 5 more minutes. Pour white wine into the pot and allow to evaporate. Add chicken broth, bring to a boil, and add persimmons. Cover and simmer until squash is soft, about 20 minutes. Remove bay leaf and puree with an immersion blender until smooth. Season with vinegar, salt, and pepper.
Made as written. Delicious! After tasting it as made, I stirred in a splash of half and half to boost the creaminess and a bit more salt. Next time I will peel the persimmons and pick out the bay leaf before blending, but great recipe as is! What a delicious and healthy soup!! The soup was so easy to make, and very delicious. It felt like a rich soup, but no grease on the tongue and no bomb in the belly. I purchased a persimmon for the 1st time in my life so of course I went to Allrecipes to see what I could make! Made it exactly as the recipe states.. DELICIOUS
