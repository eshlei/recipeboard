Stir together the avocado and lemon juice in a serving bowl; add the green onion and cilantro; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or store covered in refrigerator with avocado pits in the bowl to keep from browning.
I make a very good guacamole although i use mostly the same items i also hope that you will try mine in which i add a small amount of diced fresh tomatoes and also add about 1/2 ounce of taco seasoning you would really be suprised at how wonderful it tastes!! Even better with a little bit of cumin, chili powder and fresh diced red onion , jalapeno and a Roma tomato. I do like the lemon flavor better than lime, but that's just my preference. I love this!! It was great! Yes  I added diced up tomatoes. Simply delicious. I used limes instead of lemons, though. I made this as written. I think it unfair to make a review on a recipe when you change it the very first time. I don't care for tomatoes so when I found this I was elated. It is delicious. And it will be my go to from now on. And super easy. The only problem I have is letting it chill first to let all of the ingredients meld, lol. Next time I might add a.bit of garlic but that would be it. I ran out of guacamole mix last minute and tried your recipe! Thanks for saving the day! Canâ€™t have a puking pumpkin without guac!! I used ingredients I had in My pantry: garlic salt, lemon juice, & onions. It tasted delicious Very easy and super fast! Everybody munches down on this stuff!
