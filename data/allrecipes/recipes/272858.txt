super easy, super delicious. I cooked my chicken with skin on, bone in. They took 25-30 @ 400 degrees. This will be a new favorite of mine. Love this recipe for chicken thighs. Itâ€™s super easy and just the right flavours. I used bone in skin on thighs. They were done in in 22 minutes. I'll use a little less salt next time. The skin was nice and crisp, will make again. I followed the recipe exactly except my thighs were skinless.  Didn't seem to matter because they were juicy and very tasty!  Will make this again and again and again... Very simple and tasty. Two things - I would reduce the amount of salt and I would double the spices. Will be making this again. Made this with boneless, skinless thighs and it turned out great! This was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except I doubled the seasoning. The timing was pretty accurate, maybe 2-3 minutes longer.Thanks for the recipe! Awesome will save and make again Delicious and so easy! I prepared as directed, however, I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs; took about 21 minutes to cook. It was perfect--juicy, tender with crispy skin! Will definitely use this quick and easy recipe again!
