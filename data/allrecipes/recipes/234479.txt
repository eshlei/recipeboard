Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter and peanut butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth; beat in brown sugar and white sugar until incorporated. Add egg and vanilla to creamed butter mixture and mix until smooth. Whisk oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until just incorporated. Carefully fold chocolate bars into dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Subbed 1cup peanuts for the chocolate bars as I thought these would be too sweet with more sugar. Everything else was exactly as stated in the recipe. These were crispier than I expected but nice flavours. I baked mine about 11 - 12 minutes as I used a cookie scoop to measure and that’s a bit bigger than a teaspoon. Will make these again but maybe less butter, more peanut butter and oatmeal. My These were delicious and easy to make! I didn’t have enough rolled oats, so I went 3rds on those, Quaker Quick, steel cut. All that turned out fine. I did add a little Nutella and cinnamon. The mistake I made was adding flax seed (to make them healthier) … it added an odd texture in some bites. I would recommend just follow the recipe. Will make again without the flax for sure! It took an additional 15 minutes to brown. I would increase heat on the next try. Also, I doubled the chocolate. Me an the whole Fam Bam Love crunch and peanut butter so this was a must try ... My kids and hubby loved them so much :) Thanx for sharing These were an easy to throw together nice tasting cookie, but not something I'd buy Crunch (R) bars again to make.  However, if I had Crunch (R) bars needing using, I may make these.  If I'd make these again, I'd increase the PB (double).  THANKS for the recipe!
