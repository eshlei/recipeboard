https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/258032/karaage-japanese-fried-chicken-with-honey-mayoster-sauce/
Whisk 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon honey, garlic, and ginger together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Beat egg in a bowl until smooth. Add panko bread crumbs to a shallow bowl. Dip chicken in beaten egg, letting excess drip off. Press into panko until completely coated. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add chicken, in batches, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Whisk Japanese mayonnaise, mirin, remaining 2 tablespoons honey, Dijon mustard, and remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce together in a bowl; pour sauce over chicken.
This was excellent as written! No changes needed. I had to substitute Chinese rice wine for the mirin,  and needed more egg and panko to get a nice coating. I suspect if I had cut into larger pieces, I would have had enough coating, however. Absolutely wonderful, and the sauce is to die for. I eyeballed all the ingredients and didn't have one of them, but it tastes super good! My breading didn't look quite as consistent as the picture, but pretty good still. Just made this and it's fantastic! Whole family enjoyed it just as it is. This was excellent as written! No changes needed.
