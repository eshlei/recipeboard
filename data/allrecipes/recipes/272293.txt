Very light and fluffy. I made this recipe several times. I like to add jalape√±o peppers. A little bit of cheddar cheese. Thank you for sharing this awesome and very easy recipe. This was so easy and turned out great My dog has been sick so I've been feeding him scrambled eggs and boiled chicken. Originally I didn't expect much from "microwaved" eggs and I didn't actually add any of the milk or salt. Just the 4 eggs and cooked in the 30 second intervals like suggested. They look GREAT! I was really surprised at how well they cooked up this way! Great thick FLUFFY consistency and not overly"dry" OR "soggy" like i had imagined! I'll be trying this again in the morning following the actual recipe for us humans!! Can't wait! Great recipe. Great! Came out as well as in recognized restaurants! I make for myself, so only use two eggs. After two 30 second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each, I reduce to only 10 seconds at a time. Sometimes that extra 10 seconds is enough. Other times it needs an extra 10 seconds again. 1 minute and 20 seconds all up. I cook in a large mug and scoop it onto toast immediately, as if left in the mug any longer, the eggs will keep cooking because the mug is very hot. Very easy. No need for a frying pan. Only one dish to wash.
