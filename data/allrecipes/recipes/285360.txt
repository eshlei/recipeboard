Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a small bowl. Grease a pie pan or 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Place apple slices in the prepared pan and sprinkle with flour mixture. Drizzle milk, maple syrup, and vanilla over top; toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender (not mushy), 25 to 30 minutes.
These turned out well and tasted good; the maple syrup was enough sweetness. I would suggest stirring them halfway through baking. At 20 minutes, the top of mine was starting to darken too much. I stirred and put back for another 10 minutes.
