Oregon Fall Salad
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240094/oregon-fall-salad/
Whisk olive oil, cider vinegar, sea salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour salad greens into bowl and toss in dressing to coat. Cook and stir hazelnuts in a skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, 4 to 7 minutes. Transfer hazelnuts to a work surface and roughly chop. Layer apple slices, Cheddar cheese, and hazelnuts atop dressed greens.
This is such a nice, simple, light salad. My bags of greens were 7oz each (and I used two), so I knew I'd have to increase the dressing to coat it all. I upped the EVOO to 2 TBSP and the vinegar to 1 TBSP (knowing that ration works for me). I used 10 cranks of sea salt from a ginger and about 1/8 tsp of white pepper. I subbed almonds for the hazelnuts per personal preference and I used a Granny Smith apple (the tartness really worked). I can see making this again, particularly as a salad for a dinner party. THANKS for the recipe! I made this for a potluck but I did make the Allrecipes magazine version, which uses freshly toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts. It was delicious and fresh and everyone enjoyed it. I used a Cosmic Crisp apple, which was a very nice level of tartness and sweetness for this salad. Loved the combination of nuts, apple, and cheese in this delicious salad. The dressing amounts worked for me. This is such a nice, simple, light salad.
