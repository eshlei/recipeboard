Colorful Coleslaw
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/257698/colorful-coleslaw/
Place red and green cabbage, red and yellow bell pepper, snap peas, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and onion in a mixing bowl. Whisk vinegar, yogurt, sesame oil, celery seed, sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small mixing bowl until smooth. Pour over vegetables. Toss gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate until chilled and flavors combine, at least 2 hours.
This is a tangy, vinegar based coleslaw that was light and refreshing.  Loved the addition of the various veggies.  I may increase the sugar just a smidgen more next time to balance the vinegar out a bit more.   Thanks for sharing your recipe! I didn't make the exact recipe, because I didn't have all the ingredients, but the dressing is AMAZING!  Love the colors and that it is creamy, but has no mayo for our mayo-intolerant house.
