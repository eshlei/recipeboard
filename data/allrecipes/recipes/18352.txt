Good recipe. Chill mixing bowl and beaters in freezer for 10 minutes before preparing. Also,can experiment with different extracts to get just the right flavor to go with that perfect recipe (rum extract,almond,banana,coconut,maple,coffee)~tried them all :) Whipped cream is a great addition to cut fruit, pies and cakes.  Usually the items it goes with are already sweet.  I had never added sugar to my whipped cream as it is delicious as is and is a good balance for the sweet treat under it.  I had never before considered adding vanilla, which  proves to be a nice subtle addition without adding extra sugar to an already sweet dessert. What a fun and easy recipe. I'm using to to top my bread pudding and caramel sauce. Added double sugar. üëåüèª I read the comments (as always) and doubled the sugar. So tasty! I use it everyday for my coffee Loved it, quick and easy. Great recipe but definitely needed more sweet. needs a little more sugar
