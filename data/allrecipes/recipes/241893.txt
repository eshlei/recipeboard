Ladies and gentlemen, start your juicers. What a delicious mix! Definitely add the jalapeño, you deserve it. Great for brunch with eggs. Thank you for the recipe!!! I have already made this a few times and I love it. Really good, and different! It's like a kicked up V-8 variation. Definitely add a bit of salt as suggested. I used half the amount of jalapeño, but could have used more.  My hubby already asked me to make 'that green drink' again! If you're the adventurous type, try this! If you're picky, scroll on by! LOL I suspect those that didn't like this used a blender, not a centrifugal juicer. Noope not for me I couldn't even drank half of it. Ladies and gentlemen, start your juicers. What a delicious mix! Definitely add the jalapeño, you deserve it. Great for brunch with eggs. Thank you for the recipe!!!
