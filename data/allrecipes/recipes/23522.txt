Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Clean and dry pumpkin seeds so there is no goo or strings. Melt butter onto a cookie sheet. Spread pumpkin seeds evenly over the buttered sheet and sprinkle with salt and water. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan every few minutes to ensure even baking.
These are a fun snack. We like ours with Lawry's Seasoning salt and I prefer cooking mine on the stove. That way you can monitor the seeds better and add more seasoning as necessary. These are always better after they have cooled awhile and become crispy - put them in a tupperware container to store. Well , it was pretty easy. Good but needed more seasoning.  Will make it again. Exactly how my family always made them! Yum! Awesome recipe! My family loved them. Took a lot longer than 15 minutes and sprinkled some garlic powder and paprika for a little added flavor. YUMMMMM I make these for my son. I do add garlic powder and occasionally seasoned salt. I drizzle with a little olive oil when toasting. These are awesome!! Very easy and my 7 year old got to help. My family loved them and we cannot wait until Oct so we can have more. used parchment paper, and olive oil instead of butter and oil. they turned out great! these were awesome. I had to cook them longer than that though.  Very Easy to do...very yummy!
