Creamy Chicken Ramen Soup with Dill

Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Break up noodles and toss into boiling water. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken, sour cream, seasoning packet, and dill. Simmer until heated through. Serve garnished with green onions.
I liked this recipe because it  is so simple and filling. The chicken also added some protein and flavor to the noodle dish.  I think the dill added some extra tang that made regular ramen noodles so much better. I followed recipe exactly.  This was very heavy on the dill.  Using less would help.  Flavor other than dill wasnâ€™t bad but the dill overpowered everything. I made this for myself and my 3 boys. I doubled the ingredients for the recipe so it would be enough for everyone. There was way too much dill. We didn't love it but it wasn't bad either. I had an idea of maybe substituting rotisserie chicken for the canned, if I get the urge to try it again. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 5 oz rotisserie chicken instead of canned. I enjoyed the savory combination of the dill and sour cream and especially liked the crunch of the green onion garnish. My husband and I actually split this for a light lunch.
