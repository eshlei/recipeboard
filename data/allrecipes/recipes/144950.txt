Deep-Fried Mushrooms
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/144950/deep-fried-mushrooms/
Stir flour and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Mix in water and egg until smooth. Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of batter will sizzle and float to the top. Working in small batches, dip mushrooms into batter and fry in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
We loved, Loved, LOVED these. This is a favorite of ours when we go out to restaurants and I really am glad that I "finally" found a recipe that is what we order out. Definate keeper. Thanks for the post. Perfect These were so fun to eat!! üòÄ I added a splash of tobasco, other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was good and easy to make. Very easy and quick recipe I‚Äôve been looking for something as crunchy as this!I tweaked it a bit with Cajun spices, but followed it to a tee otherwise. Oh, and I also used self rising flour instead of all purpose, because it has baking powder in it which I‚Äôve read also helps makes a crunchier batter. This is great and I will definitely use this recipe again!! Thanks for sharing!‚ò∫Ô∏è I loved it. I added cayenne powder to the flower and garlic salt. Then I rolled them in plain breadcrumbs after placing in the flour mixture. So good and a little crunchy. I used almond flour instead of regular flour and garlic powder. It was really good. Followed the recipe to the letter.I don't know how it gets any better.Thank you very much. These are absolutely delicious!! My husband is making more right now! ‚ò∫
