Delicious and easy. I make these all of the time, but have started to use only a few spices and herbs - at this point, I feel the outcome is best when only garlic powder, salt, ground black pepper and chili powder is used. Sometimes I'll add some rosemary, but most times I do not. Thanks - love these!!! Definitely a keeper. My go to for oven roasted potatoes. Hubby thought it was the best heâ€™s ever had. Thank you for sharing. This is my favorite recipe because of all the seasonings mixed together. I also use it to make oven roasted cauliflower and sprinkle Parmesan cheese for 5 minutes at the end It has the house smiling like Olive garden taste is good easy to make  I took potatoes right out of my garden cleaned them so good  thank you ðŸ˜Š Perfect! For this recipe, I used 1/2 tsp ground dried garlic,  added 1/2 tsp rosemary, kept all else the same. Another variation - added bias-cut carrots, cooked for 20 mins at 475. So good! I changed up  the spices for family likes and disslike. turned out great!! These herbs were too strong for me and my family...plan to cut the volume of ingredients in half to see if we like it better. Works very well and my family loves it.  Thanks for the recipe
