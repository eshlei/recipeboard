My husband is currently eating his fourth bowl of this stuff, no lie. I actually made the whole deal in my cast iron skillet--sauteed, simmered, added biscuits and stuck it in the oven. Turned out perfectly and made a neat presentation, as well. This is so good. Family and husband approved. I wish there was a place to add notes on saved recipes. I made several changes that I want to remember for next time I make it. Made very few adjustments.  Definitely use 1.5  of a rotisserie chicken for  the best flavor.  I also slightly sautÃ©ed the Chicken with the mixed vegetables before adding the liquid.  I would recommend splitting the flakey layer biscuits in half and overlapping them slightly for the crust.  Absolutely divine! I have to double and triple the sauce because my husband loves it so much he always complains that thereâ€™s just not enough (after he licks his bowl clean). (And I add broccoli). ðŸ˜‹ Perfect Delicious! My only gripe is that it requires many, many measuring cups and spoons and dishes. delicious
