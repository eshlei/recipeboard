Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom with cooking spray. Beat sugar and butter together in a small bowl until crumbly. Beat in flour and almonds. Press over the bottom and up the sides of the prepared tart pan. Beat cream cheese in another small bowl until smooth. Beat in sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Spread over the crust. Arrange pear slices over the cream cheese layer. Combine sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the pears. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until filling is set and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes. Cool tart on a wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before slicing.
Loved it! easy and delicious. I did not have almonds or almond extract, so I used pecans and vanilla extract instead. Outrageously good! This has become our favorite dessert. I can't believe it has only three reviews, which is why I'm here writing my first ever review. I make this exactly as written and it's both gorgeous and scrumptious. You do need the special tart pan with the removable bottom. I found one that is 11 inches instead of 9 inches, so I did the math and multiply the ingredients by 1.5 and it comes out great. When you get to Step 3, be sure to add almond extract rather than vanilla, which I assume is a misprint, judging from the ingredients list. Give this a try. You will not be disappointed! A little too sweet if you add all of the sugar topping. Loved it! easy and delicious. I did not have almonds or almond extract, so I used pecans and vanilla extract instead. First time making a tart - ever, and it turned out to be very delicious.
