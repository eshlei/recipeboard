Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in yogurt, then cranberries. Form dough into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet. Pat down into a 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick circle. Sprinkle with sugar and cut into 8 segments. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are slightly crisp and top is browned, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and redefine the cut marks.
Great scones. I changed a couple of things as i have a dairy allergy.i used Lactose free butter,lactose free vanilla yogurt. I used light brown sugar as i did not have turbinado sugar, and google said that i could .Very lovely light scone that goes great with any hot drink.Thank you Lindsay for a lovely dessert.Lyndsey,this is my review Manella. Most scones I have made are dry, but, these were moist and delicious! I added some orange zest just because I like it with cranberry.  Mine were done in about 17 minutes. These were light, fluffy, sweet, tart, and delicious! Definitely a keeper. My advice is to check on the browning a few minutes early depending on your oven, as mine was starting to get overdone when I checked at 19 minutes. This recipe is fabulous and very easy. I used whole wheat flour and plain Greek yogurt so I added a splash of vanilla. I will definitely make it again. I used red turbinado sugar on top because that is what I had. Great scones.
