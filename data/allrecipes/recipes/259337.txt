https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/259337/vegan-cashew-cheese-rolled-in-cranberries-and-nuts/
Cover cashews with cold water in a bowl and soak for 4 hours. Drain. Combine cashews, nutritional yeast, vinegar, miso paste, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended. Taste and adjust seasonings according to your taste. Grease a piece of parchment paper with oil. Transfer cashew mixture onto parchment paper and form into a roll, twisting the ends of the paper to secure. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Mix walnuts, hazelnuts, cranberries, and rosemary on a plate. Remove cheese log from fridge and paper and roll in the nut mixture.
I added black pepper and red pepper flakes to mine. However, it doesn't say where  to add the vinegar to the log. I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! I added extra nutritional  yeast and apple cider vinegar, as well as lemon juice as it helps hide any cashew taste. I also blended in a bit of crushed red pepper for a kick!Making it again for Christmas! delicious! I was surprised how yummy it tasted
