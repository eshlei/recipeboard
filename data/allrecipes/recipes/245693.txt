Sweet Potato Tempura
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245693/sweet-potato-tempura/
Make the tempura: Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons ice water, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, and salt until just incorporated; batter should still be very lumpy. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a wire rack over several layers of paper towels. Dry sweet potato slices with paper towels. Dip three slices into batter, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Fry in the preheated oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sweet potatoes to the wire rack. Repeat to dip and fry remaining sweet potatoes. Make the dipping sauce: Whisk rice wine and soy sauce together in a small bowl. Serve with tempura.
The secret to a crispy tempura batter is the shock between the hot oil and the cold batter, so I chill all ingredients, including the flour. Nice! Great recipe!Tempura sweet potatoes are my FAVORITE!!! So glad to have a recipe to make at home!I used  3/4cu tapioca flour with 3tbps ap flour. I also only had 1 cu vegetable oil so I fried them in smaller batches. I also double fried the potatoes and they came out fantastic! I didn’t have a wire rack so once they cooled they got a little softer and less crunchy, butthey  we’re perfect when they were still hot!10/10 will definitely be making again. The secret to a crispy tempura batter is the shock between the hot oil and the cold batter, so I chill all ingredients, including the flour. Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the list of ingredients says 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, and the instructions say 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon. I used the latter and it worked out great! Just as good as the ones I had at Edo . The dipping sauce was yummy as well
