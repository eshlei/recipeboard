Po' Boy Remoulade Sauce
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286130/po-boy-remoulade-sauce/
Mix mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, chives, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper together until well combined.
Very adaptable to emphasize the flavors desired. Recommend using a microplane grater for the garlic. 1.17.22 I didn’t use this for a sandwich, rather, used it as a dipping sauce for steamed shrimp which was a nice change from traditional cocktail sauce.  Followed the recipe with the exception of adding some Creole seasoning (Tony Chachere’s®) and a bit more cayenne (personal taste). This is a very nice, tangy multipurpose sauce which could be used on so many things in addition to a Po’Boy sandwich.  This one’s a keeper, thanks for sharing your recipe!
