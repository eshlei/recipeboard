Whisk green onions, 1 tablespoon black vinegar, honey, sesame oil, garlic, coriander, ground ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Slice the tofu into bite-sized pieces. Place in a shallow baking pan. Add the green beans. Pour the sauce over everything. Allow to sit to marinate. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine rhubarb and jalapeno in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add coconut sugar, coconut aminos, remaining 1 tablespoon black vinegar, fresh ginger, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Mix together. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Turn the heat to medium. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer until the rhubarb and the jalapeno are soft, about 15 minutes. Cover the tofu and green beans with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the green beans are tender to a fork, about 30 minutes. Uncover and remove the green beans. Set them aside to keep warm. Put the tofu back into the oven, uncovered, until the sauce is bubbly and has reduced, another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, roast the cashews by putting them onto a small oven-proof dish and roast while the tofu is baking. Roast until browned, about 10 minutes. When cool to touch, chop the cashews. Serve the tofu and beans topped with the rhubarb sauce, chopped cashews, and a lime wedge.
I loved the spices in this dish. I  made it as written and it was delicious! I  used frozen green beans and fresh firm tofu. I also used fresh rhubarb from my garden for the sauce.I  plan to.make it again soon! I  really liked the sauce, it was a great addition to the roasted tofu and beans. I  plan to use it on grilled or baked chicken as a barbeque sauce.
