Since the combination of bananas and peanut butter in a smoothie intrigued me I decided to give this a try. I LOVE peanut butter and could eat it by the spoonfuls...(too bad they don't make a fabulous fat free version). Just as the submitter states it's refreshing and tasty! I froze my banana so I only used a little ice and to lighten this up I used skim milk (a bit less than called for to get the desired consistency) along with reduced fat peanut butter. Not only is this good, but it's good for you too and perfect for breakfast or a nice snack! I loved it! I didn't put any honey in and didn't switch anything out and it was delightful!!! I added a heaping tablespoon of premium instant coffee for a hint of coffeeshop fare.  Lovely! It was delicious! I'm not a big fan of banana or peanut butter, but this was really good. And instead of milk I used whipping cream and water Easy to make. A great option when youâ€™re required to get calories on board. This is my new favorite thing! This is a keeper, especially with oats in it. This is satisfying.MBK
