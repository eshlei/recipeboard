This was very good. I didn't have All Spice so looked up a substitute for it online and it said to use 1/3 tsp ground cloves, 1/3 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/3 tsp of nutmeg for replacing 1 tsp of all spice. I did that and it turned out great.  Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving. Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!! I donâ€™t even like cider but this was AMAZING!!! I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self. You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good! I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good! I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.
