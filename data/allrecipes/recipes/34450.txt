No need for the food processor. I put this mix into an empty aldi spice jar / grinder that used to have their herbs d'provence mix in it. This way, the mix is fresh ground whenever I need it. I made half the recipe and it was just enough to fill my spice jar. This is delicious.  I'll never buy Italian Seasoning again! Thanks for the recipe. Helpful! What fun & it's a breeze to do.  actually only used herbs from our garden & arranged/sprinkled them on.  Except the Basi,l which I added after taking the Pizza out of the oven. Excellent seasoning mix for Italian flavor. Easy to make! great.  I didn't have marjoram but it was still tasty.  thanks! Made yesterday and having birthday party today for the family. Spaghetti and big meatballs. Taste test magnificent. Used only what I had o n hand in my garden ( basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary). Doubled the basil and used 1/4 of the rosemary. Added it to a roasted vegetable sauce and it was perfect! I used 1T oregano; the pepper made it too hot; it was great in pizza sauce - too hot in home made crackers.
