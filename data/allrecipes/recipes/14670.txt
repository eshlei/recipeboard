I used this recipe for my first roast and have used it religiously since. My only advice would be to watch your cooking time. My roasts have always been done between 5-6 hours (on low) and they come out very tender. Overall, a very easy and tasteful recipe. This needs garlic, onions, rosemary and thyme..salt,  pepper, mushrooms.. Otherwise it's way too bland.. I'm a retired chef..never would use this recipe. You must sear the meat too. Will need more liquid for 3 to 4 pound roast. About 1 cup. I cooked cabbage wedges with it Flavorless, not fork tender st all after 5 hours. Would bot recommend Not just a family favorite. I serve it for company as well and everyone says it’s the best they’ve ever tasted. You probably will need a large spoon to take the roast out of the crock post, as it’s so tender it just falls apart. I always use chuck roasts. They’re the best.
