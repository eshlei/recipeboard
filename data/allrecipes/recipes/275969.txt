Stir together apple cider and 4 tablespoons caramel ice cream topping in a 4-quart slow cooker until smooth. Cover and cook on Low for 3 to 4 hours, or on High for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Mix together sugar, salt, and apple pie spice in a small shallow bowl. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons caramel topping into a small saucer. Dip the rims of 8 mugs or heatproof glasses into caramel topping, evenly coating the rim; then dip into spice mixture. Ladle hot cider into mugs. Add 3 tablespoons spiced rum to each mug and garnish with a cinnamon stick.
Very tasty with or without rum. I recommend to warm you up on a chilly night!
