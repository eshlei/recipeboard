I have been a lurker around the allrecipes site for a few years now and many of the recipes I use have come from this site but I have never reviewed anything here before because I hate signing up for stuff online (usually leads to tons of spam) but this recipe compelled me to sign up so that I could leave my review!What a wonderful cake!! I was looking for something that used no eggs nor oil, and I found this one. I was a bit skeptical but decided to try it anyway and it came out of the oven about 20 minutes ago. YUM!! My 7 year old (mr. picky)is eating some now. If I could give it 6 stars I would.I would suggest to the reviewer that had a bad experience with it, to try again. Perhaps you had a bad batch of flour or something else that day. This recipe is so easy to make instead of 1/2 cup apple sauce I did 3/4 cup and a tsp vanilla extract I made this cake 2 times actually. The first time I made sour cream spice glaze for the top the second time I made it an apple sauce unsaid down cake it was very good. And I added vanilla extract and I put pumkin pie spice instead of clovers. Made it have an apple pie flavor. I made this gluten free, I added an egg, and instead of butter I just added a 1/2 cup of my home made applesauce. And I didnâ€™t have raisins, but I had dates, I chopped them up and added some. Sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Yum ðŸ¤¤ also I used a square pan. Very simple recipe I made it gluten free and butter free and it was still fabulous!!  Thank you for the starter recipe and the add in ideas from others was helpful too :)!  I prefer pecans so used those instead and added 1 tsp vanilla :) I didn't use the clovers because I don't like the taste of them and I added vanilla in mine and chopped up some walnuts and it was it turned out marvelous and it so delicious. made cupcakes I had a jar of applesauce no one liked, so searched for a recipe like this. Oh my goodness. Followed the recipe except I used pecans instead of walnuts. I had to cook it almost 55 minutes but I believe it's because of my oven. This is definitely a keeper. Absolutely delicious and incredibly moist!
