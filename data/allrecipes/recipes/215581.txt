Process the cranberry juice, strawberries, blueberries, watermelon, banana, and figs in a blender until smooth and creamy. Enjoy immediately or keep cool in refrigerator.
I used a large chunked frozen banana and omitted the figs only because we did not have any. Even missing the figs, this smoothie was delicious. My family favorite. A Crowd pleasure , worth the effort. Great flavor and a  definite keeper. I will be making this again. I think I'll make some Popsicles out of this as well. Perfect for lactose-intolerant folks! this is a fantastic recipe. Flavorful smoothie without the tang of yogurt. I subbed some frozen raspberries for the strawberries and also added a few scoops of protein powder and did not add the figs. Perfect natural sweetness with no additional sweetener required. Thank you Soup Lover-Sue for a nice smoothie recipe!  UPDATE 5/1/20:  Wanting to use up what I had in the freezer, I also added raspberries. Sampling it, I didn't like the texture from the seeds, so I strained the whole thing, and it was better. It's so good and easy. My husband loved it. I used home made cranberry juice to cut some sugar.  Upped the watermelon  and figs  (  6 figs :0) to use them up. I used a large chunked frozen banana and omitted the figs only because we did not have any. Even missing the figs, this smoothie was delicious. This is a lovely summery drink.  I did leave out the figs (personal preference), so I upped the amount of banana.  Thanks, Sue!
