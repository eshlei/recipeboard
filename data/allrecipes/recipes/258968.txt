Grease a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned, about 5 minutes. Whisk together eggs and salt in a medium bowl until combined; pour over chorizo in the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes.
This is a basic recipe that I have been eating my whole life, Chorizo con Huevos. Nothing is ever measured, just add to liking. If you're a chorizo lover like I am then it's more Chorizo than eggs. Tasty Easy! Added sharp cheddar a couple county style potatoes  and made  burritos! Yummy ðŸ˜‹ Came out perfect! Cooked half the chorizo so I cut the eggs in half. Will make again! I love this tasty, simple, quick, low carb meal.  I did add bell peppers and onions to mine, but it's great as is.  If you like spicy foods, add a little hot sauce to serve or jalapeÃ±os while cooking.  I don't understand why someone who hates chorizo would try a recipe with chorizo in the name and rate it low.  That's not a recipe issue.  It's a personal taste issue. Superb low carb high fat. Hooray for a diabetic like moi. Iâ€™ve been eating chorizo and eggs for years, but would always scramble the eggs first, THEN add the chorizo. This recipe helped me understand the deliciousness of cooking the chorizo, and then putting the eggs in. I sprinkle with a bit of cheese and maybe salsa after itâ€™s finished. Delicious recipe Found this while searching for something new for breakfast. Simple and delicious.  I added a little shredded cheese at the end. Was a quick yummy treat to pop in a flour or corn tortilla!
