Place raw cashews in a bowl. Add olive oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powder, and salt; toss to coat again. Preheat an air fryer to 330 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread out seasoned cashews in the basket of the air fryer. Cook for 3 minutes. Shake the basket and cook until golden brown, about 4 more minutes. Transfer cashews to a paper towel lined plate and let cool completely. Store leftovers in an air-tight container.
Flavored cashews are all the rage in my house, but!? I could not find raw cashews anywhere?!?!? So finally used 1c plain, roasted - lightly salted - which means I followed exactly EXCEPT the salt (omitted). While I was worried the garlic powder was too much - it wasn’t. However, the lemon pepper was faint and just not quite enough. I only made one batch (1c) to make sure I didn’t wreck an expensive purchase. It was a fun snack! Thanks SLN!
