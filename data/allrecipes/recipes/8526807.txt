Another hit from Chef John. I used Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream and it was still delicious. So good! I love that it is one pot! I added 2T of Worcestershire and a little dried mustard as has been suggested by other posters and the taste was fantastic! I did forget to add the flour but the sour cream thickened it up just fine. My husband said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt change a thing‚Äù!Thanks chef John The flavor is the only thing that needs a little tweaking.  Otherwise, I'm looking forward to adding this recipe into my rotation. I love Beef Stroganoff and Hamburger Helper is a guilty pleasure. This combines both into an easy, quick meal. I‚Äôm not sure where someone thought it was too much work. It‚Äôs cooking, not opening a box. I did use more onions, mushrooms and garlic‚Ä¶because I had extra. I did add, per another reviewer suggestion, 2 tsp Worcestershire, 1tsp steak sauce, ¬º tsp garlic and onion and a 1/8 tsp dry mustard. I used penne pasta and it took about 12 minutes to cook. Definitely a keeper. Recipe was easy to follow I omitted the mushrooms unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have any and I used no salt stock instead of broth. It was delicious! A keeper, It was an easy to make recipe but I found it a little lacking in flavour. I didn't have any vodka, used it all to make vanilla üòÑ. Next time I'll try it with some dried mushrooms added. It was so much better the next day, imagine that. Overall a decent recipe that I saved.
