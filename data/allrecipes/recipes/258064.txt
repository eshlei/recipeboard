Filipino-Style Congee (Lugaw)
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/258064/filipino-style-congee-lugaw/
Bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Cook, stirring constantly, until rice is soft, about 25 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the hot oil until golden brown, 5 minutes. Transfer half of the garlic to a small bowl. Stir ginger into the garlic remaining in the saucepan; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken; season with fish sauce and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken mixture into the rice. Dust annatto powder over rice using a strainer; stir until dissolved. Add hard-boiled eggs. Simmer on low, stirring constantly, until rice reaches a porridge-like consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in spring onions. Garnish bowls of congee with reserved fried garlic.
An excellant and simple dish to prepare! Delicious and comforting especially during winter months in the east! I made this without the annatto powder. Okay, so I found this recipe to take a while to make and use a lot of dishes. I also found that it needed LOTS more salt, so I added a few pinches of salt and about triple the fish sauce. Also, my rice burned on me so next time I will reduce to a very low heat after it boils. Lastly, this recipe needs WAY more than 5 cups of water... I must have used 15 and next time will probably use about 20-23 - it boils down quickly so it requires a lot of water. Overall, the taste was fine and it's a nice recipe for a different type of cuisine. this was wonderful... tasty and garlicky.  I used sliced fried garlic on top and sliced the eggs on top for presentation
