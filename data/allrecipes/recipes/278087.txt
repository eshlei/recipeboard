Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix bread crumbs, mayonnaise, egg, Worcestershire, mustard, Cajun seasoning, salt, cayenne, and pepper together in a small mixing bowl. Fold in crabmeat gently. Form into 3 equal-size crab cakes using a biscuit cutter. Place cakes on a parchment round and transfer to the air fryer basket. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until browned, about 6 minutes more. Serve with remoulade sauce on slider buns.
Can/do you put the parchment paper in the air fryer? This was so good! You only need to air fry it for 3/4 minutes each side. It tasted like restaurant quality! Family was very impressed! Too much breadcrumbs but I needed a starter for air fried crab cakes.  i know what to do next time This had WAY too much breading. I doubled the recipe exactly. Even with 1/3 the amount of breading the recipe calls for it is likely too much. The flavor of the bread was fine but there was little to no crab flavor at all. At least I only wasted 8 oz of crab. If you try this recipe use 1/4 to 1/3 the amount of bread crumbs. Can/do you put the parchment paper in the air fryer? So fast and easy in the air fryer! Instead of Remoulade sauce I used Yum-Yum sauce.
