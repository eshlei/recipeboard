The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/216759/the-perfect-cinnamon-roll-icing/
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Blend in milk and vanilla, then gradually mix in confectioners' sugar and salt until smooth and fluffy.
I made the recipe exactly as stated. It came out perfect. For me, it covered 12 rolls, not 24. I did use buttermilk in the icing only because I had a touch left that I had to use. This was just what I needed--thanks Cara! NOTE: This recipe does not say to sift the powdered/confectioners sugar. I really didn't mess with that but I did run a wisk through it to break down the bigger lumps in the sugar. It just makes for a smoother icing. For those like me who forget to let the cream cheese sit out before using, I let the cream cheese sit in a small bowl on my heating pad (the same one I used to help my rolls rise) on low/medium for 20 minutes or so to soften it up. Even though I did follow this recipe pretty closely, it came out looking lumpy and unappetizing, no matter how long I mixed it. My kid and her friend didn't like it. Yummy! I put it on top of my Apple Pie Cinnamon Rolls. (I also doubled the cream cheese) Bursting with marijuana buttermilk & cinnamon flavor! The absolute best way to bake your cake! I just added double the cream cheese Sooo good. Perfect consistency and flavor for baked goods. Love this recipe!!!! Totally recommend it. It is bursting with flavor (and cinnamon!) Though, way better cold. Love it. I needed a last minute icing in a hurry.  This was it!!  The flavor is wonderful, it's very easy to make, and it drizzled perfectly onto my apple cinnamon rolls.  I am definitely saving this. Yum
