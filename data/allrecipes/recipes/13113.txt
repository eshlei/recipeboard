This recipe was excellent!! A restaurant near my house makes the best Tomato Basil soup, so I was looking for a recipe to imitate theirs. I would recommend only blending 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup, leaving some chuncks gives it a nice consistancy. Also pealing and seeding is not a necessity. I did it the first time and not the second time and could not tell the differece. Also if your in hurry canned tomatoes work well as a substitute. Dont skimp on the basil, thats what makes it wonderful. Overall A++ a really great soup for any occasion. LOVED!  I used four huge garden-grown fresh tomatoes.  I did poach them to removed the skin but kept the seeds and pulp.  I diced up half of a large onion.  The 4 cups of tomato juice was just right.  I used a slotted spoon/ pasta drain scoop to pull out the thicker tomato chucks and blended them in the bullet.  NOTE:  do not fill a bullet with hot steamy food it will explode.  Fill 1/3 and give it a quick blend, then return to soup pot and process  more of the thicker tomato chunks.  The butter and Heavy cream made it sing. The fresh basil is a beautiful touch.  I added about a TBL of sea salt and cayenne pepper to give it a slight charge.  Fabulous!üçÖ. Top it off with shaved Parmesan cheese and fresh cracked black pepper.  üòã I had basil from my garden but it was dried. Would have rather had fresh. I used Roma Tomatoes as for they are what I grow in Idaho. I saut√©ed finely chopped onion and garlic.Added it as well. Wash really yummy üëè I made this and served it for our Bible Study group of 13.  Got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I made it per the recipe. I do think I will use flour or cornstarch to thicken next time. I roat my tomatoes  and I add a cup of cooked orzo .with some crusty bread it makes it a meal in itself I added some garlic and onion powder.  Also a little sugar.  I didn't have heavy cream so added a little half and half with a few pats of butter.  The basil made the soup. I love this recipe! To me it‚Äôs the best of summer. Great recipe!I was told years ago to add sugar to it to tone down the acidity.  I use 4 table spoons.  Awesome recipe. Yummy just as is!! Great flavor. I was hesitant to use heavy cream, so I used 1/2 n 1/2. Next time, I'm going for the cream! I did blanch the tomatoes, so they were easy to peel. Reading reviews, I won't worry about the seeds next time. Definitely a keeper. Oh! That basil.
