My Filipino family's chicken adobo recipe is very similar. We use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup water, 2 bay leaves, and omit pepper. A generous seasoning of granulated garlic can also be used in place of garlic cloves. A nice variation is also adding a little ground ginger. Delicious over steamed white rice! perfect I tried this recipe and my mom really loved how it tastes. It is flavorful and the instructions are easy to follow. so easy to make & delicious I love this adobo dish being that iâ€™m filipino but my moms recipe calls for a cinnamon stick, and she used 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth and light soy sauce and the flavor is out of this world. She never measured  in any ingredients and i donâ€™t either and it comes out delicious every time. She was the best cook and made filipino food healthy but tasty. miss my little mama in heaven ðŸ’• So I have been making this recipe for about 10 years, you need to do a ratio of 2 cups vinegar to 1 cup soy sauce, I highly recommend Datu Puti soy sauce and vinegar, if you go to Asian markets they sell it in a 2 pack together, their soy sauce and vinegar is milder than American/Japanese  versions and PERFECT for this recipe. I also use 3 bay leaves, and 2-3 cans unsweetened coconut milk (secret ingredient)  family favorite and can be done with chicken or pork. This is a favorite dish from over 30 yrs ago,  I have made it in a crock pot, with and without skin, never browning first.  I even made it with canned chicken while we were sailing in the Bahamas to serve at pot lucks.   This is always a hit with requests for the recipe.  I like to double the liquid ingredients to make lots of sauce.  I use either white or yellow rice with it.  The smell is wonderful while it cooks.
