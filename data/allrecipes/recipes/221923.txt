Good stuff. I personally feel that wrapping the slices with nori (seaweed used for onigiri) makes it taste better. I have been making these tamago for some years, calling them, in my bed and breakfast, "YouTube eggs" because I learned to make them on YouTube originally. Recently I received an induction-ready pan from Japan because  my old pans were aluminum. The details in this recipe, plus the serving ideas, are very helpful. Much appreciated. From now on, I will add a little sugar, a little mirin, and serve on top of rice in the way you suggest. I used to make these often.  My chickens just started laying, so I wanted something different for breakfast.  I often top w slices of avocado, for Tamago maki, and sprinkle the tamago w furikake when using avocado.  So yummy!!!Iâ€™ve also made these into hand rolls.  Good stuff!!!i have also ground up my dried Shiitake stems up in the grinder, stems which are often discarded by others, or used for soup,  add the ground Shiitake first to the oil, then proceed w the egg rolling in the pan.  I use a 8 x 8 rectangular ceramic pan for these.  Oil generously.  The ground Shiitake is in the center, after rolling the egg. Omg delicious,  I made tamago maki with avocado. Love this recipe, first time making tamago and using my special pan! My rolling leaves much to be desired though! good! After I stopped giggling at the name...tamago means egg so its titled egg egg.... hahaha.. I got to work making the dashimaki tamagoyaki. Very good recipee. I personally added a pinch of salt and used a sieve to make fluffier eggs. I loved it so much! Turned out great! I made this several times. For me, I removed the sugar and dashi, and as the layers cooked I added very thin mushroom slices and the occasional piece of Nori.To serve, I presented with Hot Mustard and Soy. WOW- this makes eggs actually taste GOOD!
