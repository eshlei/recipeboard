Mom's 5-Star Lemon Meringue Pie

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Beat sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl until smooth; pour into pie crust. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar and vanilla extract, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks; spoon onto the pie to cover completely. Bake pie in preheated oven until the tips of the topping begin to brown, about 3 minutes.
I picked this recipe because the first one I tried failed epically and I really like how the lemon center turned out after baking it I did make a couple adjustments I used a regular pie crust baked for 12 minutes alone and then baked for another 10 minutes after putting the filling in then after putting the top on I baked for five minutes. I cannot wait to cut into this thing that selling looks amazing.
