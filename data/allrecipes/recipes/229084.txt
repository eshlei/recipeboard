Mix cream cheese and walnuts together in a small bowl. Slice one side of each date lengthwise using a small sharp knife, creating an opening. Carefully spoon cream cheese mixture into the middle of each date; pinch the dates closed. Stack them on a plate with cut sides down.
Made exactly as written. Wish I would have bought chives to create better antennae with. These were good! I think next time I'll do more to kick up the flavors though. Cinnamon and nutmeg in the cream cheese mix, maybe? Or sitting on top of something.. like crumbled chocolate cookies. Extra flavor and more effect. Yummm....These are so easy and good! A keeper for holidays and potlucks. I made it but I used full fat cream cheese since I had it on hand and added fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon for flavor. They tasted great! We could not stay out of them. But I do recommend adding these spices to the recipe. I think the dates would be bland without them. Awesomely good and my visitors loved it This is an old family recipe we make every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. we put powdered sugar on top and just call them "stuffed dates". We only do this using medjol dates. Made exactly as written. Wish I would have bought chives to create better antennae with. These were good!
