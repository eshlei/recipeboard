To make the marinade: Mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water in a bowl; stir in light soy sauce, sugar, and salt. Add chicken; toss to combine. Set aside to marinate for 20 minutes. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add bean sprouts; cook just until blanched, about 30 seconds; drain and set aside. Combine 1/4 cup water, oyster sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl; set aside. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Add black bean sauce and chopped garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken and marinade mixture; stir-fry until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in oyster sauce mixture; cook until heated through. Cover and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in bell pepper; cover and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes more. Dissolve 2 teaspoons cornstarch in 1 tablespoon water. Stir in bean sprouts and cornstarch mixture; cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes more.
This recipe is easy and delicious, just like you'd get at a restaurant. I found it very salty, and would cut the salt in half next time. This recipe tastes just like what I order from the Chinese restaurant.   I did use less chicken and added more veggies (carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts.)  You can do whatever you want with that, but the sauce is great.  I do like things spicy, so next time I will add some crushed red pepper.  (I order the same thing made spicy at the restaurant.)
