I doubled the pesto and olive oil and added garlic (2 cloves). Also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and some Mrs Dash tomato basil garlic to liven it up a bit. Served with chicken apple sausage. My hubby said this was a definate keeper. This recipe is really good I like it. The only changes that I made on this recipe  is that I put 5 TBSP instead of 2 1/2 of pesto sauce because I have a bigger family and I like pesto sauce and It turned out great. Sooo good!I sprinkled a little shredded mozzarella on top, cuz, you know, from Wisconsin! Tastes amazing! New favourite pasta recipe :) Added rotisserie chicken, basil pesto, Italian peppers and onions and garlic. My favorite for now. We started by heating oil and then cooking the onions until translucent. Then added the pesto sauce and threw in a little pasta water and salt and pepper as well as red pepper flakes with spinach stuffed tortellini . It was delicious and a big hit with hubby Wish a recipe of pesto was included right here. Other than that looks great! Cook chicken with onion and tsp garlic, then add rest.  Grate block of parm.  Great with rotini pasta. Added 3 x the pesto and oil, added chili pepper flakes added garlic cloves. Added 3x the cheese as well.
