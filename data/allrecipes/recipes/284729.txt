Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in white chocolate chips and cranberries. Mix in buttermilk and egg until just combined and dough forms a shaggy ball. Roll out slightly and cut into 12 triangles. Place on the prepared baking tray. Brush each scone with a little cream and sprinkle with some coarse sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until barely golden around the edges, about 15 minutes.
Didn’t have buttermilk so replaced with 1/2 cup heavy cream & decreased sugar to 2 Tbsp. I will definitely make these again. I followed this recipe to the letter, and found the dough a bit too wet.  In the future, I’ll add a little more flour to compensate for that.  So wet that I had a difficult time cutting into shapes and then moving them onto the baking sheet.  The dough spread out, and the scones lost their triangular shape.  I also had to bake for 25 minutes rather than 15.  But what matters the most is how they taste, and they taste FANTASTIC.  They’re tender, buttery, fruity, and chocolaty, just rich and delicious.  I’ve had this recipe saved for a while, and I’m so glad I finally made it.  Thanks for sharing.
