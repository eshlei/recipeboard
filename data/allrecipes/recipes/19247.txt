This recipe makes a great cookie! You can tailor it to your liking: take them out a bit early for softer cookies, or bake them a little longer for a crisp cookie. I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn't grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself! The most delicious oatmeal cookie. Super soft and addictive. I added dark chocolate chips. Best recipe I've found. I doubled. I used 3x's vanilla but used Mexican vanilla. Before baking second half, I added 1/4 cup Ghirardelli 100% cocoa. Awesome. Chewy and moist. I had to bake for 14 minutes. These were really good. I don't like reviewing recipes that I changed, but the dough before I altered it was great I had a few bags of nearly empty things that I added to the mix: half a cup of craisins, half a cup of white chips, and half a cup of walnuts. It's definitely a great recipe to work with. also, I just rolled them into balls and didn't flatten. still came out flat I added a cup of raisins when I added the oats. My husband prefers ridiculously large cookies, so I rolled them into about 3 inch diameter balls, flattened them before popping into the oven, and baked them for about 18-20 mins. They came out perfect - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! I substituted a tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of cinnamon and added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder in addition to 1 tsp soda. Turned out great. I also used canola oil instead of butter and plan to substitute 1/2 c of applesauce and 1/2 c of oil instead of 1 c oil next time. I really like the ginger in stead of cinnamon. This was su a simple recipe! I added and extra teaspoon of vanilla and substituted the oats for some lemon creme and blueberry instant oatmeal packets (in the same quantities of course lol). They came out AMAZING!! I opted to not do the sugar press with the fork and instead made the dough into balls and flattened them a bit with my hands to like a burger patty thickness. These were easy to make and the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had, we did add chocolate chips and walnuts to them. I really recommend these! I just made these cookies and they look a taste great thank you for sharing this recipe. I added a cup of peanut butter and it turned out terrific. Delicious! I added two tablespoons molasses, and pecans, cooked for eight minutes, they came out soft in the middle and slightly crunchy outside. Perfect! This is one of those recipes that I go back to again and again because it's delicious exactly as written, yet wonderfully versatile as well. I have made these cookies several times and added 1 cup of chopped pecans on one occasion; 1 cup of raisins (soaked in boiling water then well drained) another time; or 1 cup of dried cranberries or blueberries a different day -- OR any combination thereof. Next time I intend to add chocolate chips or maybe dried apricots. Feel free to experiment, knowing that this cookie recipe is an excellent foundation. The best cookies and the flavor itâ€™s so good. I made them and my family loved them. Made just as recipe stated. Didnâ€™t have raisins or any other suggestions to add. Every one loved them! I was looking for a recipe for "soft" oatmeal cookies. This is a winner. I also added a few chopped raisins and semisweet mini chocolate chips. These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had in my life!!!! My son enjoyed these cookies.  I added raisins and a small bit more cinnamon. Very good recipe ðŸ˜‹ Too much cinnamon. I would substitute the 2 tablespoons of water to 1 and 1/2. I wanted a little heftier cookie. I also put my dough in the refrigerator for 10 minutes while cleaning up. Overall the cookies were a big hit! I add 1/2C English toffee bits and 1/2C chopped dates.  My crowd loves them.  They can't just eat one.  Very addictive.
