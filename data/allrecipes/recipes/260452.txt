Greek-Style Chicken Salad
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/260452/greek-inspired-chicken-salad/
Place cucumbers in a colander; set onto a plate. Toss cucumbers with 1 teaspoon salt. Let rest to draw about liquid, about 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels. Place red onion and 1 cup cold water in a bowl. Let soak until the strong onion flavor is weakened, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse. Combine cucumbers, red onions, Greek yogurt, Kalamata olives, dill, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, and black pepper in a bowl. Fold in chicken, feta cheese, and tomatoes. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate salad for at least 1 hour. Stir salad and serve on lettuce leaves.
Left out the pepper and used Roma tomatoes instead but this is what a Greek chicken salad of this type should be! Full of flavor  and light. Tzatziki is made with  a lot the ingredients used in this and souvlaki marinade as well.  I put it in a pita and topped with the lettuce  etc. but you could use bell peppers if you're gluten free/keto...Yum! I've made this using fish - either grilled yellowtail or yellow fin tuna. My family and I love it! I had to use dried dill but otherwise followed the recipe using Just Chicken from Trader Joe's.  The only thing I'd do differently would be to use less yogurt---at least to start with and then add what you think is needed.  What a great way to use leftover chicken!  We had a nice dinner!  Thanks!
