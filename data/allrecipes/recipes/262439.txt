Pour water into a pot. Add onions and tomatoes, cover, and bring to a boil. Add milkfish, eggplants, beans, radishes, okra, and green chile peppers. Boil for 5 minutes. Stir in watercress and tamarind powder. Cover, reduce heat, and season with salt. Boil for 5 minutes until fish is cooked through.
Donâ€™t have watercress and white radish so I skipped the ingredients
