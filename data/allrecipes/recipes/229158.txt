Pour Schnapps into a shot glass. Very gently pour Bailey's over top; let sit until it begins to clump and curdle. Gently pour in grenadine.
We made these and served them at our last Halloween party and they were a huge hit!! Really cool and yummy!  Definitely a shot your guests will remember. I'm sure this would have tasted better if the liquor was chilled before we made them.... Very tasty - sweet shot.  Everyone liked the taste.  Our Irish cream didn't curdle as much as we would've liked (maybe we poured too much or didn't wait long enough), but it still looked cool and was a big hit at the party!  The more grenedine, the more bloody and sweeter the shot. We made these and served them at our last Halloween party and they were a huge hit!!
