Great recipes with these adjustments.Sauteeed chopped onion and minced garlic in olive oil. Then added ground turkey. Cooked with a montreal dry steak seasoning I use with turkey.Added in a little extra tomatoes, left out water & chili powder, added double the cumim, and two tablespoons of brown sugar. Simmered for 2 hrs (checking taste and adjusting seasonings slightly if needed) and served with shreded cheese and crackers for friends and my son. Was *gone* and had recipe requests afterwards. I so adore this site! Make once a month! This recipe is very simple to follow and tastes great. Sometimes I add beef broth instead of water but it is delicious either way. I realized pretty soon after adding 2 cups of liquid that was too much so I drained much of that before simmering the chili for 30 mins or so. I would recommend adding only 1 cup of liquid - I used chicken broth, I think water would be too bland. I think a bottle of beer would work perfectly and I'll do that in lieu of broth next time. As per another commentor, I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also added a dash of cinnamon. I did not have cayenne so I added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a few dashes of Tabasco and a dash of Worcestershire. I added the spices to the turkey, onion, and garlic mix  before adding the beans, tomatoes, and liquid. I find that brings out the flavor of the spices more. I also wonder if adding a tablespoon or two of tomato paste might add next time. I used two cans of diced tomatoes as I didn't have crushed. Having said all of that, I thought the flavor was delicious and actually preferred it to other beef chilis I have made in the past. The bland turkey absorbs the flavors better so you really taste the spices versus beef.  I served this over Goya yellow rice and topped some grated cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, pickled jalepenos and a few TJs corn dipper chips. This will be my go-to recipe going forward! Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. Yum! Really simple and good.I added a bell pepper and some corn. This recipe is so easy and fast for a Chili. Everyone that has tried it, loves the taste of the recipe. And there is only 30 minute Cooking time with  no fuss no muss. This is a Family Favorite. I loved this recipe.  The only thing I would change IF I was feeding others, would be a bit less chili powder.  *It was perfect for me. First time making and I loved it! I pretty much followed the directions as written except that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmash‚Äù the beans.  I also reduced the cayenne pepper just a tad based on personal preference. I will totally make this again. Had two bowls for dinner! üòâ
