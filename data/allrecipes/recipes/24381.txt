Whisk soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, honey, mustard, and pepper together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined. Add oil in a steady stream, whisking constantly until incorporated into the dressing. Pour into a glass jar and chill until serving.
This is one of the best Ginger dressings I have ever tasted. The only 2 things I do differently are add 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar and use a grinding bowl instead of mincing the ginger. Grinding it makes it more pasty and juicy. Absolutely made my pasta salad sing I love this dressing! It is exactly what I was looking for. This is a ginger dressing that actually uses ginger, and tastes like ginger. Absolutely delicious! Easy to make, tastes awesome! so good It was easy and good,  better than spending $7 on a small bottle It was very good!! My husband and I didn't care for this as a salad dressing. So I wouldn't waste what was already made, I decided to try the leftover as a marinade. We love to use it that way on chicken and sometimes shrimp. I added some  sesamy seads and It turned out pretty good
