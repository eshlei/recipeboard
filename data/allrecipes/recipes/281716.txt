Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, oil, applesauce, and eggs together in a medium bowl until fluffy. Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves together in a large bowl. Add pumpkin mixture and stir until combined. Pour into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool, about 15 minutes before cutting into 24 bars.
10.13.20 I had just enough pumpkin left in the fridge from pumpkin pancakes to make half a recipe which I baked it in an 8”x8” dish. Nothing fancy here, just a tender, moist, pumpkin-y, delicious cake! The spices are spot on, and don't even think about frosting it because you don't need it. And as a bonus, incredibly easy to make. Just enjoy its natural simplicity. Next time, I’ll add some chopped walnuts or pecans for a variation, but this one’s a keeper as is! Very nice change with the addition of applesauce to cut down on the oil.  This is more cake than bar.  25 minutes was not long enough.  My center was not set, so closer to 30-35 at 350 worked for me. 10.13.20  I had just enough pumpkin left in the fridge from pumpkin pancakes to make half a recipe which I baked it in an 8”x8” dish.
