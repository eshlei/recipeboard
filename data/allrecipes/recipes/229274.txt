This recipe is so quick n' tasty and using fresh apples Really makes a difference Five stars from me!! :D This recipe is easy and tastes great warm.  I added extra cinnamon.  I also sprinkled a sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. Delicious.  Just like my mom made.  I used 5 medium (cosmic crisp and Fuji )apples because that's what I had on hand.  Used a deeper baking dish.  Added more cinnamon because I love it.  otherwise, followed  recipe.  Second one is in oven.  First one didn't last long enough. I topped with cinnamon and sugar otherwise followed exactly. Sooo yummy & a HUGE hit ALWAYS!! I LOVE tart, so I use granny smiths and add aprox. 3 Tbs lemmon juice to the apples. OH and maybe sometimes I do 1 1/2 recipes of the topping cuz it is so soooo good! Just like my mommy's! Leftovers, NEVER! so easy to follow, quick and delicious!! Fast to do. Husband peeled all the apples with special apple peeler.I did the mixes and right now Iâ€™m waiting to have dessert, smells good It's just like the apple crisp we had in grade school 60 years ago. I love it! First time I ever made an Apple Crisp.  I made a few tweaks according to what others suggested, like 1/4 granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar along with 1/2 tsp Nutmeg.  It was supper easy and delicious.
