Banana Pudding with Vanilla Wafers

Combine sugar and flour in a large bowl. Combine egg yolks and water in a second bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the sugar mixture and mix until batter is well combined. Pour milk into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add batter and stir until mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in bananas and vanilla extract. Layer vanilla wafers and banana pudding alternately into a glass bowl. Cool before serving.
I think your teaspoon of vanilla extract would've been sufficient but thinking if 1 tsp of vanilla is good 2 should be twice as good, I used two.  Next time I will stick to 1 teaspoon of vanilla. But next time I will also cook it in a 5-qt Dutch oven. Mine almost boiled over in my 3-qt saucepan. After reading another review, I decided to layer sliced bananas on the vanilla wafers rather than mashing them and folding them into the custard. I carried this to a friend’s house and heard, “This reminds me of my grandmother’s banana pudding.” A nice compliment.  My only complaint is that I prefer a thicker pudding. Making pudding from scratch was easier than I thought it would be and tasted great! I put the layered dish in my fridge to cool but later that night the mixture turned runny and brown. I think mixing in the mashed banana added extra moisture and browning. If I were to make this next time I would chill the pudding alone and then add sliced bananas just before serving. The taste was very sweet and good, but the appearance after being refrigerated wasn't appealing. It was easy enough to make and really good so I would recommend this one you get five stars from me.
