Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Evenly spread the apple slices in the prepared dish. In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice and water, and pour over the apples. Drizzle apples with honey, and sprinkle with cinnamon. In a bowl, mix the brown sugar, flour, oats, and butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the apples. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until apples are tender and topping is lightly browned.
I really liked this recipe and i would recommend this, with a few tweaks. I chopped about 1 cup of pecans in the food processor and mixed it into the crisp mix. I also would omit the water and lemon juice because it tends to make it watery on the bottom, because the apples make their own juice, especially with the honey. Along with the cinnamon, i also sprinkled 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and allspice to spice things up a little bit. Served hot with ice cream, this is one rockin' dessert. Think i'll get me another scoop while i am thinking about it....... Addictive delight.  This recipe worked well with gluten-free flour. The family really enjoyed this dessert and I enjoyed how quick and easy it was to prepare. Took your advise and served it with ice cream. Will make this again for sure. Added a little ginger and cloves as well as the cinnamon and it was so delightful! I used Honeycrisp apples. Great served with whipped cream on top.. Will make again! The crack of apple crisp. Insanely good! Awesome flavors The only thing I changed was substituted caramel sauce for the honey I made this for Rosh Hashanah. Good concept but way too sweet. I would use a 1/4 the honey called for and 1/2 the brown sugar. Great it was a big hit.
