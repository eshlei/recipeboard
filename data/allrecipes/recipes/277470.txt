Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger in a large bowl. Mix butter into the flour mixture with your hands until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. Combine pumpkin, brown sugar, cream, and egg in a medium bowl with a whisk. Fold into flour mixture with a large spoon until the dry bits at the bottom of the bowl have been incorporated. Pat the mixture into a ball with your hands and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Continue to shape into a ball; gently press down and out, forming the dough into a flattened circle, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. If the edges start to crack, just place the palm of your hand against the edge and gently press the dough back in. Dust a large, sharp knife with flour and cut the dough into 6 triangles. Slide the knife under each to help you lift and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until scones begin to turn light brown in color, 12 to 16 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool. While scones are cooling, mix confectioners' sugar, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves for glaze together in a small bowl. Drizzle over scones while they are still warm.
I added craisins and walnuts to them!! So Delish!
