Hubby really liked these. The finely diced onion is very nice. Tip - if the potato mixture will try to stick to your hands when forming the patties. I used an ice cream scoop and wet my hands. Placed a scoop of the mixture onto my wet hand and then gently flattened them into patties. You don't really need a half cup of oil - just enough to coat the bottom of a heavy non stick skillet. Made 11 cakes using a blue handled ice cream scoop. It was amazing I followed the instructions and my batter mix is still in a since powder. Maybe the egg is an ostrich egg...
