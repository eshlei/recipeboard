Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs, onion, 2 tablespoons BBQ sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in large bowl and mix by hand. Line a sheet pan with foil and spray with cooking spray. Shape meatloaf mixture evenly into a rectangular shape. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Brush with remaining BBQ sauce (or more as needed) and bake until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees C (73 degrees C), about 15 more minutes. Slice meatloaf and serve with extra BBQ sauce if desired.
I used half and half Italian sausage and ground beef. I also added garlic powder onion powder and Italian seasoning. I skipped the barbecue sauce and used ketchup for the topping. Just added mushrooms and bacon strips on top I used half and half Italian sausage and ground beef. I also added garlic powder onion powder and Italian seasoning. I skipped the barbecue sauce and used ketchup for the topping. Excellent meatloaf! (And I’m not a huge meatloaf fan) The garlic is noticeable but not overdone. Loved the bbq in it and on top. Next time might even put more in the meatloaf. Great recipe! I liked everything about this meatloaf - the firmness of it due to the panko and 2nd egg, the bbq flavor, and the garlic flavor (which I just knew was going to be too much but wasn’t at all!) I’d definitely make this again.
