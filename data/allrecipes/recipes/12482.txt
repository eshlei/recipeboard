CHILL THE CRUST BEFORE ADDING THE FIRST LAYER.AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED THE FIRST LAYER, CHILL AGAIN BEFORE ADDING THE SECOND. THIS HELPS THE PIE TO SET AND WILL HELP AVOID MIXING OF THE LAYERS AS MENTIONED IN OTHER REVIEWS. I have been making this recipe for years it is kid friendly and raising 4 kids that don't like regular pumpkin pie it comes out great. I don't care for traditional pumpkin either so it's a win win. I do use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk it holds up better Out of all the double layer pumpkin pie recipes this one is the best. It does not use pumpkin pie spice. This recipe uses spices that you can custom to your family's taste.                                                                                                                             I did make a change in the order I put it together. I first make the cream cheese layer and put it in the extra 2 pieces ready made crust from the elf. I cover it with the plastic lid turned over that comes on the crust and put in fridge. I then can make the pumpkin layer with the same mixing bowl and beaters.  No cleaning necessary.                                      I think I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese by  accident and it was still good. I also used half the small tub of Cool Whip. Then I use the rest of the Cool Whip on the top to decorate. I can  still  use the plastic lid to cover the pie for any left overs( haha) you might have. I don't put nuts because the pie is to melt in your mouth if you wait. The longer you wait the moistier the crust gets.                                                                                               I have been known to make the cream cheese layer and make the pumpkin layer the next day. You should wash the bowl if you do. I made this pie it was amazing. I did make a few changes though. Instead of the cream cheese cream on the bottom I put the pumpkin pudding on the bottom not filling to the top and let it set. Then I added the cream cheese whipped cream on the top. With a little pipping of the pumpkin pudding in the middle from a pastry bag. Everyone loved it. So very yummy and scrumptious. Thank you so much ☺️ Very tasty and easy to make.  No baking is an extra bonus.  I also added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as my Mom always used that to her pumpkin pies! Absolutely Brilliant. I made this for thanksgiving dinner, and it was AMAZING. Everyone loved it. Although, make sure to chill the crust before adding the first layer, and then chill it after adding the first layer to help prevent the layers from mixing. This recipe is insanely easy to make, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This pie required a LOT of chilling, I ended up even freezing between the layers because it was a huge mess. But the flavor was good! It was easy to make.I added a little vanilla extract to the bottom layer and used light cream cheese and light sour cream (1/3 cup).I omitted the cloves from the top layer. One of the favorites in our home and easy to make I love this pie I just wish it would not get runny the next day
