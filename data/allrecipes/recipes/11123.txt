Microwave honey on high until bubbly (about 1 minute). Stir in the margarine. Add the egg and mix well. Stir in the flour, cocoa and vanilla. Mix well and chill dough for several hours in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chunks of the chilled dough into cylindrical shapes in order to resemble cat poop. Roll cookies in cereal and place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve cookies in a new litter box on a bed of malted barley cereal. Use a new litter scoop to remove cookies.
I added 1/2 C. brown sugar, but it didn't really help the taste. The cookies are very bland. What helped immensely was the caramel topping I served with them, which you can pass off as... you know. The cookies alone have no taste, but with caramel, they are very good! *slurp* rly good my mans Donâ€™t make the cookies!!! Use tootsie rolls instead!!!!! Complete disappointment. loved it I made these cookies for Halloween, I heard about them from a frined and i Was so excited to make them. Looked Great! But these no NOT taste good!! Im thinking next time of trying a no bake Fudge instead. Very imaginitive! Very cute for Halloween! i havent tryed makeing these (yet) but they look really look "sick". if u are not down with tthe nkids like i am then u probably think "sick" means disgusting e.t.c but if ur down with da kids like i am u would know that "sick" meas awsome!!!! i have never tried it This was a fun cookie to make, but they taste awful! Very disappointing.
