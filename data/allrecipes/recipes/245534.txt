I love making a turkey this way! I place my turkey on a bed of thickly sliced onions and celery placed on the bottom of the baking sheet instead of on a rack. I also add just a bit of chicken broth to the pan. This not only imparts a bit of flavor but it also keeps the pan moist and eliminates any burning or smoking from the pan drying out during cooking time. This was fun and easy no real big problems and I like that it turned out juicy and not dry. Thank you for the recipe. Oh yeah instead of taking a bite out of crime I took a bite out of the turkey. üòãüòãüëç My 10lb turkey cooked with in an hour. Was done and remained moist at 400 for 10 minutes to crisp the skin. I actually used a jig saw on the backbone - done in seconds!  Wiped down the saw and all is well.  Did it outside in case of splatter. I've made this recipe several times, now, and am amazed at how well it works. In fact, since the oven on our stove died, I was sure I could never roast a whole turkey in our counter-top convection oven. Spatchcocking allows a 10 lb, or even slightly larger, turkey to fit without touching the upper element. Also, like an earlier reviewer, I discovered how easy cutting along the backbone is with pruning shears I picked up at the dollar store! I used the reverse sear method to cook this spatchcock turkey and it turned out beautifully and so moist! This method allowed the thighs and breast to cook evenly. If you don't like the herbs just sprinkle with kolsher salt and baking soda front and back no need to marinate makes it soft tender and perfect to taste plus added crunchy outside This is the only way to Roast any Bird. Another step to ensure even cooking of the dark meat is to dislocate the hip joints on both thighs. I took this tip from my very first restaurant employment experience in 1975 at Gino's Hamburgers & KFC in Northern Virginia. Thank goodness I found your recipe!  Despite thawing the bird since Sunday, my 14 lb turkey was still frozen in the center!  Spatchcocking prevented my serving dinner at midnight.Otherwise, I roasted the turkey my usual way, first shmearing it inside and out (my kids' favorite way to help in the kitchen), then sprinkling it with herbs.  Came out perfect! FIRST, A TIP to make your spatchcock experience EASY!A week or so before Thanksgiving, I purchased a new pair of $10.  pruning shears just for this task.  Any hardware or gardening store carries them. My goodness, they made short work of what I thought would be time consuming, difficult and laborious.When I first read this recipe I was worried that it would come out dry. I needn‚Äôt have worried, this recipe  was wonderful!  A deceptively simple recipe that is packed with great flavor.. Compared to traditional turkey roasting, the bird cooked MUCH more quickly.Our 2021 spatchcocked turkey was moist and so delicious. Now it‚Äôs 2022 and I‚Äôm here to view the recipe so I don‚Äôt forget any ingredients when I make it again for 2022.
