The Milky Way Martini
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142151/the-milky-way-martini/
Chill a martini glass by filling it with 1/2 cup of ice and cold water. Place 1 cup of ice cubes into a cocktail shaker. Pour vanilla-flavored vodka, white creme de cacao, and Irish cream liqueur over ice; cover and shake vigorously. Dump ice and water from the martini glass and drizzle the inside of the glass with chocolate syrup. Strain cocktail into the glass to serve.
This was great, the only change I made was using Baileys caramel Irish cream, it's a new liquor & I was looking for something to mix it with. Will definately have this again! A huge hit with my guests! I would cut the vodka by 1/4 but besides that it was ok it didn't really bring that Milky Way flavor though I think u should use the salted caramel baileys for that Try it with Smirnoff caramel and a splash of cream-heaven. I have made this for several dinner parties and it was a rave success every time.  The last party I had I used S'Mores vodka and caramel Irish cream and called it Mars Martini.  It was also a great hit. Only for those that like very strong drinks. This tastes just like the candy bar - yummmm. Thanks for sharing! No complaints here. Perfect way to end a meal!  Will make this again, thanks Kaiti! I thought this had way to much of a taste of vodka or it was just way too strong. I didn't quite understand the point of adding ice or water to the cup. They can just be put in the freezer to get cold beforehand. The 1 Tblsp. of chocolate would be way too much to. I found, from another recipe, it is easier to just dab the rim of the cup in some chocolate then to try to drizzle it all over the cup. It is a lot less messy. I ended up having to fix this, to cut through the strong alcohol taste.
