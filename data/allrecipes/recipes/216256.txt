Place the pumpkin seeds in a container with a lid, and mix in the Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, bacon grease, and liquid smoke flavoring. Cover the container, and allow to stand overnight. Preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Remove the seeds from the flavorings with a slotted spoon, and transfer into a bowl. Mix the cayenne pepper and garlic salt into the seeds, and stir to coat well. Spread the seeds over a baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with additional salt. Roast the seeds under the broiler until toasted and golden brown, about 8 minutes; turn the seeds over twice during broiling. Cool to room temperature.
This review is about the cooking method not the recipe… I was wanting to make pumpkin seeds but didn’t know how to roast them and there are so many different recipes with different times and temperatures that it can be a little overwhelming! We carved several pumpkins this year so I had plenty of seeds to play with so I split them up to try some different cooking methods. I tried this one first because it didn’t require soaking or drying and it wasn’t going to take an hour. After I made these and tasted one I decided not to even waste my time trying the other cooking methods these came out perfect! Thanks for sharing your cooking method! Taste excatly like what it should.  I made a triple batch and so since spicy seasonings can get pretty intense if there is too much i reduced the amounts by halfx3.  Came out great.  My kids love it. Just enough spice to warm the cauldrons of your soul and keep the goblins away but not enough to scare away the ghost in you. Smoky, spicy goodness. Way too much stuff for pumpkin seeds.  Not a good flavor combo in my opinion. So-so. Was a bit too spicy for my liking
