Allow sharp and white Cheddar cheeses to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, green onion, and garlic. Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in flour and dry mustard. Cook for 1 minute (mixture will be thick). Add broth all at once. Cook and stir until bubbly. Add beer and cream. Stir in corn and potatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Gradually add sharp and white Cheddar cheeses, stirring after each addition until cheeses are melted. Stir in bacon, Parmesan, and hot pepper sauce. Heat through. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes before serving. If you like, top with additional green onion and bacon. Serve with additional hot pepper sauce.
Very good
