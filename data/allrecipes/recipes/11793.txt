German Spaetzle Dumplings

Fill a large pot halfway full with water and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so water just simmers. Meanwhile, mix together flour, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk eggs together in a small bowl. Add eggs alternately with milk to dry ingredients. Stir until smooth. Working in batches, press dough through a spaetzle maker, or through a large-holed colander or metal grater, into simmering water. Cook 5 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or spider and drain well. Melt butter in a large skillet. Add spaetzle and cook, stirring gently, until heated through. Serve sprinkled with parsley.
Great recipe, the flavor is BETTER! than our favorite authentic German restaurant. The nutmeg makes it so good, my family raved. I served this with pot roast in a red wine, mushroom gravy and roasted asparagus. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! **By the way, a Ziptop bag with 4 or 5 small wholes punched with a skewer was a lot easier to handle than the strainer method. The texture was more authentic as well. Easy peasy. Delicious. Used the zip lock bag trick recommended here. Just a corner snip, and squeeze a bit, and cut with scissors. Made w sauerbraten. I 6x this recipe for a crowd of 10 people. so 6 cups of flour and 12 eggs, etc. Always turns out great! fire browdy So easy to make and so much easier than rolling and cutting noodles.  I use a large colander and a spatula and add to simmering homemade soup.  Delicious! It is awesome. Brings back many memories. This is a good one. Excellent recipe.  Authentic, traditional taste! Lecker! Sehr gut!I like this recipe. It is portion-friendly and easy to double if needed.The nutmeg makes it taste like Christmas and the white pepper gives it a little punch.  This is my go-to side when I make pork loin.
