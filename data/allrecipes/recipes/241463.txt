Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 minute. Add red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and parsley to garlic; cook and stir until peppers are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix shrimp and tomatoes into pepper mixture; cook until shrimp begins to warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Add lemon juice and cook until shrimp is cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes.
This is a wonderful shrimp recipe that is so quick to make and has great flavor. I used only red peppers (personal preference) and served it over risotto. Thanks for sharing! Added some red onion & 1 tsp. of Old Bay. Delish!!  Love all the fresh veggies and lemon broth. I used a bit more butter and a dash of salt. Served with linguine. Winner! I stuck to the recipe until the end. I added heavy cream and Parmesan.  I tasted it before and it needed something, hence the additions. Good flavors, I added mushrooms, donâ€™t be stingy with the lemon & use good fresh sustainable shrimp! I served with/over orzo with more veggies!
