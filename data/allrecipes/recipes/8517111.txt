TikTok Salmon Bowl

Use a fork to flake salmon onto a microwave-safe plate. Top with rice and place 1 ice cube on top. Cover with a microwave-safe lid and microwave at low power for 30 seconds. Uncover and check temperature. If salmon and rice are not warm enough, cover and return to the microwave for another 30 seconds at low power. Uncover and remove ice cube. Drizzle soy sauce, Sriracha and mayonnaise over the top and toss everything with a fork until well-combined. Garnish with torn pieces of nori, sliced avocado and kimchi.
Not the best, but decent when in a rush I was pleasantly surprised with how good this was.   I used Japanese BBQ sauce instead of soy and it turned out really well.   A very fast and easy bowl to make when in a pinch.  If you aren't into salmon, you can substitute it with any other kind of protein.
