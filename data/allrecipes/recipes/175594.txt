Dashi Stock (Konbudashi)
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/175594/dashi-stock-konbudashi/
Wipe off any dirt from kombu with a paper towel, being careful not to rub off the white powdery deposits on the seaweed. Soak kombu in water in a saucepan for 30 minutes to soften. Transfer kombu to a cutting board; cut several slits, lengthwise, into the leaf. Return kombu to water in the saucepan; bring to a boil. As soon as water begins to boil, remove kombu to prevent stock from becoming bitter. Stir bonito flakes into kombu-flavored water; bring back to a boil, then remove pan from heat. Allow dashi to cool. When bonito flakes settle on bottom, strain dashi through a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter.
What can I use to replace bonita flakes Great starter for any Asian recipe. Add ingredients of your liking for a delicious soup. I followed it to the letter of the recipe for a perfect stock. Itâ€™s important not to boil the seaweed, or it will get bitter and slimy. This recipe is so simple and so elegant. Just a couple ingredients and water, it's all about technique for delicious flavor. Sometimes I don't use bonito, and make the stock with just dashi kombu Very easy recipe, yielded perfect dashi. Wouldn't change a thing. Perfect. I made the best miso soup out of this base. Good Excellent! Don't be afraid of adding the full amount of bonito flakes. It lends a smokey fish flavor to the stock that makes all the difference. Used this as the base for the Nabeyaki Udon soup that is on this site. What can I use to replace bonita flakes Easy to make. I used dried kelp knot instead. This is the base for miso soup (among other recipes) and is what makes the soup so good!  Thank you for the easy recipe!
