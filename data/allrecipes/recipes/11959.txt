We really enjoyed this!! I did some playing around with it as others have. Replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta and I used more tomato sauce and paste to make more of the sauce as I have one of the old crockpots that's just huge. I also put in some Italian seasoning and some roasted garlic. Just make sure that all your noodles are covered with the sauce and it will come out just great. The time was a little different for me too. It only took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours in my pot, but you have to remember that all crockpots are not the same, the size and shape can change the timing a great deal. I've made this twice now and it has come out wonderful both times. I serve it with Mama D's Italian bread (from this site) and a salad and what a meal!! Thanks Kim for a great way to make homemade lasagna without all the fuss! Nobody in my family believed that it was from the crockpot!!! I LOVE IT and my Italian Mother loves it too !!! I am planning on making it again after I make a large batch of spaghetti sauce in my slow cooker. I will use the sauce in the lasagna :) This was the best lasagna I ever made. It came out very good. Easy to follow receipe. I have been making lasagna for a  long time! Never tried a slow cooker for lasagna. It came out fantastic! I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese. Itâ€™s lower in saturated fat. It came out perfect!
