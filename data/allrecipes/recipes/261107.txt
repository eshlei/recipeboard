Pour water into the bottom of a pressure cooker (such as Presto). Place a trivet into the pressure cooker and turn the heat on high. Place potatoes in a single layer in the pressure cooker and lock the lid. Cook over high heat until the pressure regulator reaches 15 psi, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow pressure to drop naturally, 10 minutes. Unlock and remove lid.
I had huge potatoes 3 filled up my pot, of course I had to add more time.my new favorite way to make baked potatoes. I tried russet's that weighed about 0.7 lbs each.  10 min at 15 PSI then 10 min cooldown wasn't quite enough time.  I'll try 12.5 or 15 minutes next time.  This softens the skin and makes it more edible than oven and is more even than microwave. Thank you for this great recipe! It’s perfect on a very hot day when you don’t want to fire up the oven m. Potatoes came out just perfect and very quickly also. I had medium sized potatoes and they cooked perfectly.. I have a small instant pot and cooked 2 potatoes.  Came out perfect.  I put some evo and salt and pepper on them.  Put a few minutes in air fryer oven and is now my go to "baked" potato recipe. I had huge potatoes 3 filled up my pot, of course I had to add more time.my new favorite way to make baked potatoes. I used an Instant Pot set on manual for 10 minutes and natural pressure release (about 10 mins). Worked great, tastes almost like baked.
