Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine flour, oil, and sugar in a bowl. Pat into a 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, beat sweetened condensed milk, eggs, lemon juice, sugar, lemon zest, and baking powder together until just blended. Pour over the cooled crust. Return to the oven and bake until the filling is set, 13 to 17 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before cutting into 24 bars.
This was sooo good! Made the recipe as is, Crust was light, flaky, it gave it the perfect texture for the lemon cream..Next time I want to try it with a graham cracker crust, but this recipe is perfect as is! I just like graham cracker crusts, lol
