Yaki Udon
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8539106/yaki-udon/
Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. Remove root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and light greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside. Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for garnish. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on first side, about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more minutes. Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about 1 minute. Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced greens of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve immediately.
Pretty good. Followed exactly except I had regular bok choy vs baby. I also had a leftover chicken breast from another recipe - added here; which submitter Marianne suggests. I could also see scrambled eggs working here too. Simple but having never traveled to Japan, seemingly authentic?  If you like a little heat, add a bit more siracha. As written, heat is pretty mild. Overall good Udon recipe! Thanks Marianne Williams! Pretty generic. The garlic and oyster sauce drown out everything along with the soy sauce. Needs meat as well.
