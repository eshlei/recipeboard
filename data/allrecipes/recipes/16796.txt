Very good, but excellent after adding an equal amount of salt to the sugar. (If you like Kettle Corn, you'll love this. It's not too sweet this way.) Also, since I HATE having to cut these darn things in half, I just bake them whole for about an hour at 375. Then they can be cut in half with a butter knife! I then broil for 5 minutes to melt the butter/sugar/salt mix. My son didn't like it.I substituted the brown sugar with 100% maple syrup. I'll make this for Thanksgiving. Such an easy dish to make!! Taste so good if you are a squash lover Heat Acorn squash in microwave 1 minute before slicing it length-wise. Tried out this recipe except I cooked at 400 degrees. I also used 1 pound of butter versus one TBSP,  tripled the brown sugar, added salt, marshmallow, mayo, a dash of pre workout and at the end, drizzled with fresh juice and rain water.JUST KIDDING, I don’t “try” recipes just to pick them apart and add my own suggestions. If I did that, I might as well post my own recipe. I made as it and it was fantastic…. I’ve actually made it 2x just this week. i cut mine in half and added the brown sugar, butter  and raisins. the raisins are really good in this. i added about 1/2 or more of water in the dish around the squash.  always turns out great
