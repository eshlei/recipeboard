This recipe is nearly identical to my italian mother and grandmother's recipe. We use a full 32 oz container of ricotta, mixed with two eggs and italian seasonings, and only 12 oz of mozzarella. We also layer - starting with sauce in the bottom of the pan, then pasta, then ricotta/egg mixture, then mozzarella, repeat. Top with parmesan or romano cheese.Oh, and it's better the next day. Definitely a make-ahead possibility. Not tasty. It was fast and easy to put together but not sure if dumping all the ingredients together then putting in a back dish didn’t turn out as nice as other recipes I’ve tried. The texture seems off. Too....much....cheese. Not enough sauce. The amount of cheese and noodles drowns out the sauce, and I even used two 24oz jars. The taste was ok, but would not make again. I make this all the time but add spinach, garlic and onion powder in the ricotta/egg mixture and meat sauce at the top before the cheese! 6 years of making this and I still love it! This recipe is pretty decent, I would add more sauce than the recipe calls for. The amount of cheese in this dish drowns out the  32 ounces. I recommend a tad more like 42 oz. Or almost 2 jars of sauce. Idk where 32 ounce pasta sauce exists but I typically see 24 oz.
