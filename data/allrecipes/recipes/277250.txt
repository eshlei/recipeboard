Combine milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir constantly until mixture thickens to the consistency of pudding, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Add lemon juice and whisk until smooth. Return pudding to the heat; slowly stir in egg yolk mixture. Increase heat to high and boil, stirring constantly, for at least 2 minutes. Stir in butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Pour thickened custard into the pie shell. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine egg whites, remaining vanilla extract, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Whip with an electric mixture until a fluffy meringue forms. Spread meringue over the custard. Bake pie in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
It's a good simple recipe I believe the original used bottled lemon juice if you use fresh I suggest using less juice. The custard recipe was so Ono. The 1cup lemon was too much for us, made everyone pucker up. Lol.  Remade it with less lemon juice like the picture with blueberries & it was just right for us. Bake time closer to 50 min. Butter flaky crust from scratch makes anything better. Aloha!
