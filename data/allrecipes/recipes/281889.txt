Combine cranberries, jalapeños, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended, working in batches if necessary. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in sugar, lime juice, salt, and pepper.
This dip is delicious! Perfect balance of sweet and spicy. You can serve it in a bowl if you like, but I prefer to spread softened cream cheese in the bottom of a pie plate and pour this dip on top. Absolutely scrumptious! This was delicious! I blended everything in the food processor and it turned out like a chunky salsa and had it with chips. We will definitely make this again! Omg so good!!! Used 3 jalapeños instead of 6 and juice from one lime instead of two. different spin on cranberry sauce, tasty Can I make this a few days ahead of time This dip is delicious! Perfect balance of sweet and spicy. You can serve it in a bowl if you like, but I prefer to spread softened cream cheese in the bottom of a pie plate and pour this dip on top. Absolutely scrumptious!
