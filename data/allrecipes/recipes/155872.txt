Fill a glass with ice. Pour in peach schnapps and apple schnapps; top with cranberry juice.
Wicked! It really does taste like one. Tastes good. Smells fabulous. But I wouldn't say really candied apple. More Jolly Ranchy. Maybe better as a Martini Eh, it was okay but won't make again. Good.  Very sweet...duh... Delicious! Put it in shaker and served it as a martini Very good! I added a splash of vodka so this drink would pack a little more of a punch (it had been a rough day). This is really good. Next time I will shake these together and serve it as a martini. Wicked! It really does taste like one.
