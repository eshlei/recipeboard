Pasta Verde
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/269771/pasta-verde/
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, cook poblano peppers over a gas flame, turning periodically with tongs or a fork, until skin is charred on all sides, about 7 minutes. Seal peppers inside a plastic bag; allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 8 minutes. Remove and discard skins and seeds. Place peppers, sour cream, water, chopped cilantro, vegetable bouillon cubes, garlic, and black pepper in a blender; blend until creamy. Pour sauce into a large pot over low heat; bring to a boil. Drain spaghetti and add to the sauce. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese and cilantro leaves.
So fast and easy to make! It was delicious !! Love love love  this pasta recipe!  I followed the recipe and noticed the cooks notes to add serrano peppers for added spice. I have roasted hatch Chile so I added 1-1/2 peppers instead of the serrano and it was fantastic. Don't skip on sprinkling  parmesan cheese on top when serving. I also suggest saving some of the pasta water in case you need to add a bit to the pasta. Mine needed a little after it sat in the pan waiting for us to get a second serving.This is now my favorite pasta sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Very easy and tasty
