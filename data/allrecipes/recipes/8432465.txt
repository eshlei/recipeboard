https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8432465/garlic-parmesan-spaghetti/
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Add pasta water and Parmesan cheese to the skillet with the garlic. Stir to combine. Add spaghetti and parsley. Toss to evenly distribute parsley amongst spaghetti and serve immediately.
This was delicious! The only change I made was subbing the parsley with basil, and that's because I have fresh basil on hand.AND....for over thinkers like me, you don't have to keep cooking once the garlic and butter have cooked for the minute. I wasn't sure and the recipe didn't say either way. Just turn off the heat and add the rest. Very delicious and satisfying for such a quick and easy meal. This was delicious!

Also I had some dry broccoli soup mix and it's turn out delicious! Thank you! I make this frequently as a side dish to go with meat, fish, or poultry.  I do add some salt and pepper, and occasionally, chopped basil and oregano.  Quick and tasty.
