Grilled Teriyaki Tuna
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23039/grilled-teriyaki-tuna/
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the teriyaki sauce, oil, garlic, and pepper. Place the tuna fillets in the bag. Seal the bag with as little air in it as possible. Give the mix a good shake, to ensure the tuna fillets are well coated. Marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Remove tuna from marinade, and place on grill. For rare tuna, grill for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. For medium, grill 5 to 8 minutes per side. For well done, grill for 8 to 10 minutes per side.
Great Ahi recipe. Taste just the way Mom use to make. I too, seared on a pan rather than the grill. Wonderful dish, will definitely make again. Wouldnâ€™t use as much olive oil if any next time. Grilled with a little bit of hickory smoke on the Weber with the top vent almost closed to slow cook. Delicious! Very good and easy too! I added about 1 Tbl of grated fresh Ginger. Definitely will make it again. The whole family loved it! I really liked this recipe melt in your mouth goodness. Great Flavor!  Easy. Good,  i put sesame oil and maple syrup that really made the difference. I marinated my Ahi tuna for a few hours in my own teriyaki sauce with extra ginger root. Then I seared tuna in a cast iron pan for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. I wasn't disappointed with the taste of the tuna steaks and teriyaki marination. I served with some white rice that was white peppered and topped with oyster sauce. did not make any changes just marinade it for 4 hours, it tasted delicious This marinade is really delicious. I think any brand teriyaki is fine. I've made twice, the first time I marinated for an hour and the second time for a 30 min. The one that marinated for an hour had so much more flavor. I got tons of compliments from my guest. Will definitely make again.
