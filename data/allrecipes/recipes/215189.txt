Delicious! I used fat free vanilla yogurt and skim milk to keep it on the lighter side. This was very good for breakfast. This recipe got me started on smoothies.  Given what ingredients I had, I substituted 2 Tbs of honey for the sugar and 1/2 cup of lemonade for the pineapple and orange juice.  Turned out great.  I also had some granola which I threw into the glass, on top of the smoothie.  It added a nice crunch!  Thanks for the recipe!!! I love it â™¡I didn't use all of the ingredients listed but I used; 1 cup banana, 1 cup strawberries, about 1 cup Chobani Vanilla Greek Yogurt, 4 tablespoons OJ & I put tasteless Collage Peptides in mine too.I will use this recipe again, it's ezpzbrze to remember & very yummy ðŸ˜‹ Came out yummy.... thank you so much for the super simple smoothie recipe for the kids and me to make! it is good Love this simple delicious smoothie. I used fat-free plain yogurt and it was perfect. I also threw in a few mango chunks only because I had mango on hand. Will definitely make this again! YUMMM!!  I added some blackberries and graham cracker crumbles.  So good!  Will be making again for sure, adding my chia seeds too. Itâ€™s wonderful, I made it for my family and they loved it!!!! The only thing I might add would be to made more the suggested, because of small portions. First smoothie I've ever made. Came out great. Was thick and tasted great. I used honey instead of white sugar and tried out some chia seeds. Highly recommend
