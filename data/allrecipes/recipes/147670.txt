Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, milk, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until dressing is well combined. Add cabbage, carrots, and onion to dressing; mix well. Refrigerate before serving, at least 3 hours or up to overnight.
This is awesome! I made with light Miracle Whip. Skipped the onion. I almost added more liquid as it seemed very light on dressing when I made it. Glad that I didn't, however, as it moistened up after sitting in the refrigerator for awhile. I also added some celery seed as we like that in our coleslaw. Will definately make this again. Thanks. Made this today for lunch. My husband is a Cole slaw snob so I was a little worried that he wouldnâ€™t like it, but he did! That says a lot. I followed recipe except I used Splenda instead of the sugar, but used same amount. It was absolutely delicious ! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. I will be using it again. ðŸ¤— our family favorite! Pretty good.  I added celery seed, and more milk. FINALLY - a cole slaw recipe that is exactly the flavor I was going for!  I've tried a hundred recipes until today...this will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Made it exactly as written - delish!! I had never made coleslaw before, so decided to follow recipe as written except  with a much smaller portion of cabbage. I also used half red cabbage. I worried there wouldn't be enough dressing, but it was just right for my 4 cups of cabbage. I didn't have 3 house to chill, but was still great This is a great Cole-slaw dressing. I've made it a couple times. The second time I was low on Mayo and just added sour cream and it was just as good. I added more mayo and less apple cider and no lemon and it came out better.
