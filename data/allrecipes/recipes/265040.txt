I made this because I was missing my momâ€™s Filipino home cooking. Easy to make and it is definitely a Filipino comfort food for me and my family. It's mouth-watering. Delicious and great. Tried it and loved it! Appreciate all the veggies in this recipe and its simple to do too! easy recipe to follow, thanks! This is my favorite food since when I was a kid,  I made this now and my American boyfriend likes it.  1 out of 10? Solid 8. Didn't use as much water, put less sugar, added peas and used ground chicken instead of ground beef. Pretty good :) i did a great job! better than when i made it last time! hmmmm Very good, but I think I needed to add more water to make a sauce. Great recipe to follow. I was craving this dish after returning from my trip to the Philippines and it came out just as I imagined it to be!! I used beef stock instead of water and just eyed how much I needed. Used one potato instead. Brown sugar 3 table spoons. One of my favorite childhood dishes. This recipe is really yummy, thank you! Also thank your excluding the peas. I agree with previous poster. I did not add all the water because I was afraid it was getting too soupy. Next time I'll start with 2 tbsp of sugar and work my way up. The 4 tbsp was a bit sweet for my personal preference so I added more soy sauce and salt to balance.
