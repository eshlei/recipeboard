Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine apples, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg for filling in a bowl; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Combine brown sugar, flour, oats, butter, and cinnamon for topping in a large bowl. Sprinkle on top of filling. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 1 hour.
Used 7 smaller apples, 1/4 cup more brown sugar at 350 for 45 minutes and Hi broil for 5 more...crispy, dark and delicious! Very tasteful, it reminds me of my mother's recipe. I love it thank you for Sharing Added walnuts. Used 7 smaller apples, 1/4 cup more brown sugar at 350 for 45 minutes and Hi broil for 5 more...crispy, dark and delicious! A very good recipe. The topping can be a little dry, so I reduced the flour by 25%.  ðŸ¤ž Family enjoyed this apple crisp. Didn't use white sugar in apple mixture I added pineapple mixed with apple omitted cinnamon in apple mixture and doubled topping to do bottom base as well. Delicious and tastes like my Mom's except she always put 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon in hers so do I. You all must try! This was OK. I've never cooked a crisp at such a low temp for so long. Usually it is 350 or 375 degrees for half hour or so. My crisp turned out very dry. I think the topping had too much oats and flour, and the long, low cooking time didnâ€™t help. We ate it, but I won't try this again. Thanks anyway.
