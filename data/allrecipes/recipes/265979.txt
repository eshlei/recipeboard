Perfect as written! The shell gets so crispy but the inside is nice and fluffy. My husband said it was the best baked potato he has ever had. He even ate the entire peel which is unlike him. I guess I know how I will be preparing baked potatoes from now on. 5 star recipe all the way! Thanks Bren! The timing is way off. 30 minutes is enough. I have a small cosori and it works like a charm everytime  at 490 for 30 minutes Good recipe I changed peanut oil, I changed to Olive Oil for better flavor and better for you. also used coarse kosher salt but sea salt is good too. I really didn't understand what people meant by a baked potato being "fluffy". Holy cow, NOW I know!! This is an amazing, super simple, and delicious recipe! I don't have peanut oil so I used my evoo. 48 minutes was the perfect time for my potatoes.Side note: Allrecipes is the absolute BEST!! I BAKED 4 POTATOES IN MICROWAVE FOR 14 MINS, WRAPPED IN FOIL, THEN AIR FRYED FOR 8 MINUTES, AND THE POTATOES ARE THE FLUFFIEST I HAVE TASTED, IF I WAS GOING TO TAKE THAT LONG TO COOK I WOULD JUST PUT THEM IN CONVENTIONAL OVEN This is the only way we bake potatoes now.  This recipe was perfect.   I like not having to pierce with a fork.
