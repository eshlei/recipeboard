Butternut Squash Soup With Sage and Sausage
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229034/butternut-squash-soup-with-sage-and-sausage/
Cook and stir pork sausage in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until sausage is browned and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in the pot. Brown the sage leaves in the hot drippings until crisp, about 30 seconds; remove sage leaves and set aside. Cook butternut squash, celery, carrots, and onion in the remaining sausage drippings until the vegetables are softened, stirring only one time after about 5 minutes. Pour sherry into the pot and stir to dissolve any browned bits of food on the bottom of the pot. Pour in chicken and beef broth and stir in brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Puree soup with an immersion blender, leaving a few chunks of vegetables. Pour in half-and-half and season with black pepper. Divide soup into 4 large bowls and top each serving with 1 teaspoon sour cream, cooked sausage, and 2 fried sage leaves.
Delicious! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe! Not sure why I didn't love this. It was good, just not zingy. I think I'll add a bit more acid to brighten it (balsamic vinegar, lemon juice...)  But it was good, and I'll keep playing with it. Paired this with a complex salad at a big family (15 of us) meal at Christmas time. I used a food processor, as I didn’t have an immersion blender. I used small sweet peppers and kept the beef and chicken broth ratio at 1:1 (no more room in the pot!). Everyone, including my picky kids, really enjoyed it. We’ll be making this one again! This was pretty easy and quick to make... Whole family lived it Delicious! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe! I added salt. I ate this with some homemade sourdough bread and it was delicious! We enjoyed this soup (omitted the sugar).Needed a touch of sea salt though.
