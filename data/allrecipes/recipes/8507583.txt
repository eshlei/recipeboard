Pumpkin Sage Pasta
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8507583/pumpkin-sage-pasta/
Heat oil in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add shallot, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are crispy, about 5 minutes. Add sage, and cook for 30 seconds, being careful so sage doesn't burn. Remove mixture to a paper towel lined tray. Add milk, half-and-half, pumpkin, salt, pepper, and chili powder to the same pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until a smooth, creamy sauce forms, about 2 minutes. Cook until thoroughly heated through. Divide cooked gemelli pasta amongst 4 plates. Top with pumpkin sauce and sprinkle reserved shallot mixture on top.
I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I did not have high hopes, as the last savory pumpkin recipe I tried turned out inedible. However, this is absolutely stunning. I love the slight flavor of the sage with the white pepper and chili flakes. The pumpkin is subtle but blends well with the other flavors at play. Gemelli pasta was a new kind for me and I was pleased as punch. The only note I might make was that it was a bit heavy on the white pepper; you could most definitely get away with halving the amound listed. Otherwise; near perfection!
