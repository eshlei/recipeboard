Atsara (Papaya Relish)
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212921/atsara-papaya-relish/
Toss grated papaya with 1/4 cup salt together in a large bowl; allow to sit for 1 hour. Drain liquid from papaya and rinse thoroughly. Place papaya in the middle of a large piece of cheesecloth and squeeze to drain as much liquid from the papaya as possible. Combine papaya, carrot, bell pepper, chile peppers, ginger, and raisins together in a clean large bowl; mix. Transfer the mixture to clean, dry jars with lids. Stir vinegar, water, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, making sure the vegetables are completely submerged in liquid. Allow vegetables to marinate in the liquid at least 1 day before using. Store in the refrigerator between uses.
I just love it with fried fish.Salamat lola. I love it , and my family loves it as well , thank you for sharing your atsara recipe , perfectly balance the sweetness , and the sour taste . ❤️ I made it yesterday. It was a hit. I made some changes like cut down sugar into half and used turmeric instead of ginger.  It turned out perfect. Not bad for the first timer. Thanks Lola. Reminds me of home. 5 stars. Thank you for sharing . Ive done it many times already. It turns out really crunchy if you squeeze and drain all that water and salt.  Really good recipe! I'd make it again. I didn't put in a jar. Just a square glass container with a snap on lid. I kept in the fridge foe a week and it was finest , crunchy, tasty and fresh. Very easy to prepare! This is the perfect relish to include in tuna salad.  And I also add some of the pickling brine to the salad. I just love it with fried fish.Salamat lola.
