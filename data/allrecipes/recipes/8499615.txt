https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8499615/air-fryer-scrambled-eggs-on-the-go/
Lightly spray a ramekin dish with non-stick cooking spray. Pour in beaten eggs. Set air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C) and place the ramekin into the air fryer basket. Air fry for 3 minutes. Stir egg mixture and cook for 3 minutes more. Fluff with a fork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Grab and go.
liked the recipe but needed to extend those Air fryer cooking times. Needed to do 6 minutes, fluff, and then another 6 minutes at 370. This is very good!! This is a quick and easy recipe to do when you dont have a lot of time for stuff! Saving this and definitely making this again! I add my cheese and/or other ingredients after first 3 min tried it in my af, taste great!!
