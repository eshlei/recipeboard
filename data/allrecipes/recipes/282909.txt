Prepare crust: combine pretzels, cookies, and brown sugar in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended. Drizzle in melted butter slowly, and pulse to combine. Press firmly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish. Prepare chocolate ganache: heat cream in the microwave in 1-minute increments until boiling. Add chocolate and whisk until combined and melted. Spread ganache over the crust and place in the refrigerator until needed. Prepare cream cheese layer: mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, and a small amount of cream in a bowl with a wire whisk to add air to the cream cheese. Add remaining cream and mix until well whipped; spread over the crust. Slice bananas lengthwise, then cut in half. Arrange over the cream cheese mixture and return to the refrigerator. Prepare pudding layer: Whisk milk and pudding mix in a bowl until pudding begins to set, 3 to 4 minutes. Spoon over the bananas and return to the refrigerator. Prepare topping: beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until frothy. Add powdered sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Spread on top of pudding layer and sprinkle with grated chocolate. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight before slicing and serving.
Way too sweet! This was a very heavy and rich dessert, I guess I should have known with 3 cups of heavy cream! If I were to make it again, I'd make some adjustments: More butter in the crust layer, it did not stick together. I think the cream cheese layer could be eliminated completely. I would only use 1 packet of pudding and cut the bananas into smaller pieces. And possibly more sugar in the whipped cream topping!
