Just a quick tip on how to brine a turkey, especially when your fridge is full of other holiday goodies! Ive done it this way for a few years now, and it works great. Instead of soaking in the stock pot overnight, I put the turkey & brine mixture in a oven bag, squeeze out the air, and tie it shut. Put the bagged turkey in a cooler with ice overnight. Perfect turkey every single year. Perfect recipe with a fresh Turkey. I will never use another recipe or frozen Turkey again üòäüëçüèΩ! I have been making this for YEARS‚Ä¶ due to high demand I double or triple the veggies surrounding the Turkey (carrots, celery, & onion + wine).Last year I did it from ‚Äúmemory‚Äù & ended up using 6ish cups of kosher salt, it was the best Turkey yet! I've been cooking turkey for many many years and  they've always turned out wonderful. However l've never once brined one...can someone please tell me why and what brining does? So juicy. Such a solid reliable recipe. Tons of compliments from family on Thanksgiving. Need it for the first time  this Christmas. Hands-down, and the best turkey I‚Äôve ever made! The meat was so juicy and delicious and fell off the bone. Also rendered the best gravy I‚Äôve ever made. The white wine definitely is the key. I will only use this recipe from now on. My Husband and I make this every year for Thanksgiving and it is always so Juicy.  Everyone loves it! WE do stuff the turkey, as well.WE put the Wine and all veggies in bottom of large Roaster!  YUM I had a heck of of a time trying to find a vessel big enough to hold my 13# turkey. After flooding my kitchen with a few attempts, settled on putting turkey in Turkey cooking bag inside plastic shopping bag, inside big pan.. soaked overnight.  Did add a few sprigs of Rosemary to cavity of bird. Cooked 3 hours, very moist and flavorful.
