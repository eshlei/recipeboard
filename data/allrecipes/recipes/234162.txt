Raspberry/Pear/Pecan Bread
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234162/raspberrypearpecan-bread/
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Place raspberries in a separate bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons flour mixture over raspberries and toss until coated. Combine pears, brown sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into pear mixture until batter is just combined. Gently fold raspberries and pecans into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in pan for 20 minutes before removing loaf to cool completely on a wire rack.
Had some red  pears to use up before they got over-ripe. Chopped them coarsely, left skins on,  subbed dried cranberries for the raspberries. Turned out well, but I baked at 350 degrees for only 41 minutes, not the NINETY minutes specified in recipe. I just had a feeling when transferring the batter to the 8 X 5 loaf pan, that 90 minutes would be too long.  If I gave the loaf 90 minutes, it would have been a dry brick suitable only for a doorstop. Basically, I followed the recipe as stated.  I noticed at once the lack of regular sugar and should have followed my instinct to add some type of extra sweetner.  I will possibly try to improve next time.  Also, I knew that  it would make  2 loaf pans.  So I am going to add some cinnamon/sugar  to this batch of loafs once sliced. I would run the raspberries through a sieve the next time, as the seeds are a huge bother and get stuck in my teeth, or just use cranberries.  The flavor was great. will make again but not with the pears, will sub with another fruit or add more berrys.
