Cabbage and Kielbasa
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18454/cabbage-and-kielbasa/
Sauté margarine and onions in a large skillet until onions are soft. Stir cabbage and potatoes into the skillet and sauté until cabbage is wilted. Add kielbasa, vinegar, salt, and pepper; cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until cooked through. Pour water into the pan, cover, and cook another 10 minutes before serving.
My Polish mother-in-law makes the very best kielbasa & cabbage and there is one ingredient you MUST add to this recipe. Red wine. Substitute the water with red wine after the cabbage has cooked down, and simmer with the rest of it. Delish!! Took other raters' advice and peeled and thinly cut 2 potatoes, fried them with the onions.  Subbed red wine for the water and it turned out phenomenal! Looks great smells good can’t wait to eat  easy to setup one pan cooking Just cooked Kielbasa (beef) and added cabbage with 4 oz water on low......salt & pepper.  Cooked slowly....it was delicious. Wonderful recipe! Followed the advice to add red wine rather than water- always happy to use red wine in a recipe.  Instead of using canned potatoes I peeled potatoes, sliced them thin and sautéed it with the onion. Made this tonight for dinner, using all fresh, local ingredients. Didn't have kielbasa, so I used fresh, sweet Italian sausage and it was delicious! Will definitely make this recipe again. Tasty! Delicious. Took the above mentioned advice and added red wine instead of water. Delicious!!!  Easy too!!! Used red wine instead of water (as others suggested) and white wine vinegar instead of red. Added minced garlic with the onions. Used carrots instead of potatoes and added green bell pepper and leftover steamed green beans.
