Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (210 degrees C) and line a 12 x 18 inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine cauliflower pieces, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and toss to combine. Spread out seasoned cauliflower in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until the edges of the cauliflower begin to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool, slightly, about 5 minutes. Combine celery, raisins, carrots, mayonnaise, red onion, and sugar in the same bowl. Add roasted cauliflower pieces and toss to coat. Transfer salad to a serving bowl and garnish with toasted pecan pieces and crumbled bacon.
Best cauliflower salad ever! I will probably take the time to make this at least twice a month if not more. All sorts of textures and I feel it is a healthy alternative salad and takes the place of TWO side dishes! Delicious. Definite keeper and will be making again. Used air fryer to quickly make the cauliflower.
