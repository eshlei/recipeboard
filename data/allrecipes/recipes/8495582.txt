Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 12 x 18 inch sheet pan with parchment paper. Combine parsnips, butternut squash, carrots, sweet potato, onion, olive oil, minced rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Spread out vegetable mixture onto the prepared sheet pan. Roast on the center rack of the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Stir and keep roasting until vegetables are fork tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs.
Cooked well and tasted good! I added green onion and a red pepper, and it turned out great
