Squeeze 2 lime wedges over apple pieces to prevent browning. Toss in a bowl to coat. Add coleslaw mix, jicama, green onions, carrot, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper. Stir in olive oil, rice wine vinegar, and remaining lime juice; add sugar, salt, and black pepper. Toss to mix. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Toss before serving.
This turned out really good. I tried to make as written but I only have a hand grater and I couldn't get that apple to grate for nothing. The little bit I could get to grate just turned into watery mush so I gave up and cut it into matchsticks instead. I made two different slaw's for taco's last night. Hubs liked the creamier one better but I preferred this one. I used both white and red cabbage to give it more color. I really liked the texture the jicama added. This is a great slaw for tacos!
