Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Spread apple pie filling in the prepared pan; top with cranberry sauce. Sprinkle cake mix over top, then cover as much as possible with butter slices; sprinkle with walnuts. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool for a least 15 minutes before serving.
Loved it! Best after thanksgiving dump cake I had everything in my pantry already! Super easy to make I would recommend using the white ceramic dish, it fills in nicely. One tip would be make sure the top and sides are covered in butter slices the one spot that didn’t have butter was dry but I fixed it by putting more butter on the top when it was resting. Enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream another must try! I made this using fresh courtland apples (sliced thick) along with the typical apple pie ingredients since I had all ingredients but the canned apple pie filling. It was delicious. A lot of compliments and zero leftovers. It took a little longer, but well worth it. Loved it! Best after thanksgiving dump cake I had everything in my pantry already!
