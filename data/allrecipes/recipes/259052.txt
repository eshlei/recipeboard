Combine flour, brown sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, cream of tartar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl with a whisk. Combine buttermilk, egg, butter, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Beat to break up the egg. Pour into the flour mixture and stir until batter is foamy and just combined. Whisk white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl. Heat a large non-stick griddle over medium-low heat. Pour 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Brush pancakes with the 5 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top with whipped cream.
I had to make 3 batches! I love this recipe but I didn't add cream of tar tar because I don't have it and I'm not a fan of adding it Wonderful response from my family. They all loved them. Who doesn't want a warm cookie for breakfast. So delicious.   Melts in your mouth!!! These pancakes were a great change from the traditional recipes. The flavor was very close to snickerdoodle cookies. I’m not much for whipped cream on pancakes, but found it to be a nice topping- light but not too sweet. this was very very delicious! As we're heading into fall I like to add some pumpkin pie seasoning too!! Our family loved these!   My husband, who isn’t even a big pancake or cookie fan, had three of these!  Easy and tasty.  They will be a new staple for weekend breakfasts. These pancakes are excellent.  My husband and I both loved them.  They are like having dessert for breakfast.  The batter was a bit thick so I added just a splash more buttermilk. It is very thick and you can add a splash more of buttermilk.
