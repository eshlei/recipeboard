Made this recipe for dinner tonight - loved it! The panko and cheese topping is so light and yummy. Next time, I will omit the salt completely. Baked in my oven in 20 minutes to golden brownness and flaky delicious fish. Served with steamed fresh veggie medley. I will definitely make this again! Thanks! Simple and delicious! Had no planko so used regular bread crumbs, was well worth it! ðŸ˜œ Flounder is such a lightly flavored fish that it is a shame to smother it with so much breadcrumbs and cheese. Way too over-powering for flounder. I had cut the mixture to 75% and it was still way too much. Next time I will cut it to 25%. Delicious! Used 1/2 the butter and sprayed the  foil covered baking sheet  with Pam. Easy and quick. 20 min at 400. This recipe was wonderful it was easy and very tasty even my great-grandson that's 3 years old loved it he had two servings of it cuz he really liked it.
