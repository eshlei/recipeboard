We loved the coleslaw. My family was so hungry that we didn't wait 2 hours to eat the coleslaw. It was still great! I wouldn't change a thing! The slaw doesn't taste quite like KFC; however, the slaw was still great. Was looking for a KFC coleslaw recipe but knew I was going to make drastic changes...shredded cabbage, onion powder, vegan mayo, almond milk +lemon for buttermilk,almond milk for milk, Splenda for sugar.... nice! Thanks for sharing! Didn't have white wine vinegar Used Red wine vinegar. I didn't have buttermilk. I added a bit of Lemon juice.I really like the sweet but that Bang of Tart is what makes it for meI will keep this recipe & go by it just not as creamy Love the Basic idea!!!Thanks a Milliion Look up shotgun red's recipes. It's under cooking with shotgun redfor KFC coleslaw on YouTube he passed away but he still has all his recipe videos on YouTube and his two ladies are still making more. All his recipes are amazing and are spot on for what they're supposed to be I liked it but I really donâ€™t think it tasted like KFC. A little too sweet. But still good. Excellent recipe! I've used it many times. used 1/2 a red/purple (?)  cabbage and 1/2 green, not spicy enough - still in fridge, I'll recheck tomorrow a.m., how to spice it up?? very good This is nowhere near KFC coleslaw! It was just ok but not what I expected. I was actually pretty disappointed.
