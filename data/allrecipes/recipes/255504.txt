Apple Smiles
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255504/apple-smiles/
Slice apple into 4 sections and cut away stem and seeds. Etch the skin of each section with a paring knife to form "lips." Carve out some of the skin to form a "mouth" between the "lips." Spread peanut butter into the "mouth." Arrange the mini marshmallows on top of the peanut butter to form the "teeth." Bite into the fleshly part of the apple so the "teeth" are facing outward.
My grandkids loved making this recipe. There was a lot of snacking on the ingredients and boisterous laughter! For the little ones, I had to cut the apple into eighths.
