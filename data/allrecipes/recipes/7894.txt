Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup sugar gradually, beating until very stiff. Cream butter and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric beater until light in color. Add egg yolks, and beat until thick and fluffy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt over batter; fold in. Gently fold in egg whites. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
Hey this recipe is great and it freezes well too. I found that this recipe worked out really well; it needed a bit less cooking than suggested but the sponge was soft and light. I tried adding a bit of pur√©ed strawberries to the mix which worked well, but judging from other people's idea I might try strawberry liqueur next time. I have not tried this one in particular, but, in defense of this recipe, genoise  is typically a dry cake.  This allows you to add extra flavor and moisture through a simple syrup flavored with any liquer or extract(thus, minimizing the egg taste)  You must keep the genoise covered and/or use quickly as it does dry out quickly.
