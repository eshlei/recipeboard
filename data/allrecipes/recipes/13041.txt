My Best Clam Chowder
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/13041/my-best-clam-chowder/
Place potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion into a large skillet; pour in clam juice and add enough water to cover. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetable mixture with any juices until just heated through. Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar and season with salt and pepper.
This was awesome. One modification, as per some earlier readers' comments: Before doing anything, I browned six strips of bacon in the large skillet, removed them and let them drain. Then, I added the veggies to the bacon fat and proceeded as described (with clam juice, water, etc.) Crumbled the bacon into the soup after it was all combined. Adds fat, but a huge flavor too. Simply outstanding recipe here -- I love the red wine vinegar idea. Thank you!! Great Recipe- was looking for a good one without pork.  Very easy to follow and great flavor. Only change I made (after making it 3 times) was to add 2 more cans of clams. Loved it!!! I made this for my family.  It takes some steps that I found hard to follow off of my phone, with a kitchen full of people.  I did the steps wrong but it still turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  I'd make it again! I did add a bottle of clam juice along with dill seasoning and bacon pieces on top. Very good! taste great but I add more clams Surprised at how easy and how well this turned out.
