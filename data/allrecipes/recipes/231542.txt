Combine cabbage, carrot, mayonnaise, cranberries, walnuts, milk, cider vinegar, and sugar in a bowl; stir well. For best flavor results, cover and refrigerate until chilled.
Love this receive! Simple, quick and I was enjoying "before it chilled" so I know it will be great later!! I did make one change!! Because I have to avoid soy, I do not use mayonnaise (have not found one without soy) so I used plain Dannon yogurt!! Taste great to me!!!! Used dates instead of cranberries. Little citrus added a nice zing! Will make again! Came out perfect. Left out nuts, but I can easily imagine what it tastes like WITH them, so rating accordingly. Made night before as others suggested. I think it's awesome with nuts but husband hates nuts. Excellent recipe! I made this for guests, so left out the fruit and nuts, just in case there were allergies or preferences. It was even better the next day! This is so good, especially after sitting for a day. I did add some black pepper and celery seed. I had to double all the ingredients. Half a head of cabbage from the garden yielded a Two qt bowl of salad but yummy Very good - added a little lime or lemon juice to pop the flavor! Turned out great! I added raisins as well and it was Delish! I made the magazine version of the recipe, but doubled the amount of walnuts and cranberries. It tasted great and kept its crunch over several days. Delicious! I am always looking for ways to make veggies more appealing. I doubled the cranberries and would double the walnuts next time. I will make this again!
