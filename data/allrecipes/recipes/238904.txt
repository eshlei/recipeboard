Being an admitted amateur cook I have my own recipe but decided to look around as I do to get ideas. Brown sugar caught my eye and I tried it with fresh cut cilantro, mushroom and dried onions in the meat then butter honey crushed croutons in the ketchup,A1,mustard, brown sugar in the sauce. Best ever hands down ...EVER! I did not use too much brown sugar and the cilantro made a fresh very fresh taste. I never post on stuff like this but felt compelled.Excellent I made it for my husband and myself & it was my first meatloaf to cook.👍My husband loves it and couldn't stop eating it😉It was very tastey.On the recipe...I added a squirt of Worstershire Sauce, a little garlic and BBQ Sauce, and gave it snap.🤠Highly Recommended !!! 😁 It was so dry and pretty much flavorless.  I'll stick to my meatloaf recipe with more flavor and moister ~ threw what was left out.  👎 Just there.  Sorry I have a secret family recipe that I typically use when making meatloaf that comes down multi generations ahead of me. Decided to change it up n try this one. This was actually really good. I added green pepper to mine. Even with the minor tweak I made it was really good. I like the croutons instead of regular bread crumbs. It made for an interesting dinner. Fantastic flavors!! Wonderful family favorite right out of the oven!! I used Sweet Vidalia onion!!
