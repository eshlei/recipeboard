Pour chicken broth, corn, black beans, chunk chicken, tomatoes with green chilies (with their juices), chili powder, seasoning salt, and garlic powder together in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®); stir to combine. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and carefully open the lid. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and top with tortilla strips, and shredded cheese, to taste.
I don’t care for canned chicken, so I buy a rotisserie chicken every time I go to Sam’s. I then remove the meat from the bones, bag it, and freeze it for recipes like this. I also make bone broth from the carcass. That’s what I used instead of canned chicken broth. I’m so glad fabeveryday included spices in this recipe. They really help to add more flavor! I topped my soup with homemade tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream. I don’t care for canned chicken, so I buy a rotisserie chicken every time I go to Sam’s.
