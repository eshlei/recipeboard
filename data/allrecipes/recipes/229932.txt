This is also the same recipe as Signature Pumpkin Pie which is also on this site. My youngest son and I made this pie together. Because I'm low on time and energy, I used a refrigerated pie crust. We mixed the pie filling in my Kitchen Aid mixer, it was less than five minutes to make it. We followed the recipe exact. This pie was done baking at five minutes before the fourty minutes was up. Gorgeous pie, VERY VERY good. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: For those of you who want a pie that tastes like pumpkin that's lightly sweetened, this one is for you. I just went on a whole odyssey trying to figure out how much 16 ounces of pumpkin (mass) is in millilitres (volume) because Canadian cans are not labelled in mass. For anyone else losing their entire minds, Canadian pumpkin cans are typically 32 ounces, or 2 lbs, which in metric volume is 796 mL. Use half a can. Now to figure out the sweetened condensed milk (my can is 300 mL). tastes good. Added brown sugar to it. Super easy and very delicious ðŸ˜‹ I loved this recipeâ€¦ Itâ€™s my grandson Harryâ€™s favourite!â€¦ I didnâ€™t make any changes except I made my own pastryâ€¦ Yum!â€¦ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ Best pie ever! I took this to my in-laws and they went back and ate every last crumb! I guess next year I'll have to make two. Simple and yummy ðŸ˜‹ My son's birthday is around Thanksgiving. This is his favorite recipe and asks for this instead of cake for his parties. I love the creaminess and depth of flavor that comes with using condensed milk instead of sugar (for the comments that question no sugar,  the condensed milk is sweet, that's your sugar). It makes the pie seem custard-like. Thanks to my cousin Monica introducing this recipe to me, I will never make pumpkin pie any other way. Recipe great I did add sugar vanilla ext
