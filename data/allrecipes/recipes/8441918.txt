I love Bibi’s recipes. Her temp and timing are always spot on! This stir-fry squash made a perfect side for tonight’s tenderloin. The added item for me was chopped walnuts. Now thats good. Light, easy & flavorful! Perfect side dish to BBQ. I love Bibi’s recipes. Her temp and timing are always spot on! This stir-fry squash made a perfect side for tonight’s tenderloin. Roasted pepper seasoning and parm cheese I made it exactly per the recipe and it was delicious! I've also made this with Hopi Pale Gray squash and with Zappolo de Tronco squash (an acorn type which is also good when baked with brown sugar and burrer), and both were great.
