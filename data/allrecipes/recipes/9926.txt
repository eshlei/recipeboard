Beat cream cheese and softened butter in a medium bowl until smooth and creamy. Mix in vanilla. Gradually add sugar, beating after each addition until incorporated. Continue to beat until frosting is very smooth. Store in the refrigerator after use.
Note:You need to know that this cream cheese frosting is for the person that wants a REAL cream cheese taste, as if they were eating actual cheesecake. This is not a sweet, sweet, sugary frosting. This is a cream cheese blessing! Not the kind you find in the container in the grocery store. This is homemade, amazingly delicious, cream cheese frosting! have made this before and it is the best cream cheese icing hands down!!!! have never tried freezing it...can I freeze this frosting? Oh My Word!!! Definitely a keeper!!!! No it was great Made this to go with the Best Carrot Cake Recipe ever.  It was delish!  I make 1.5 the recipe as posted to completely cover the cake.   I wish it was a little less soft (and I chilled it)  I think itâ€™s the nature of cream cheese frosting though.  Luckily the cake (and frosting) tasted best served cold.  Would definitely use it again. It's light, not too sweet.  It is a little soft but I will keep this cake (fresh coconut) in the refrigerator as I always do anyway. Always love anything w/cream cheese! Love the texture and flavor, also versatility of adding cocoa for chocolate icing ! This recipie is always my go to for cream cheese frosting. I've yet to find a better one.
