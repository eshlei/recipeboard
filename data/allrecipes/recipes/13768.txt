We are enjoying these hot out of the oven, and I want to post a quick review because it is always so helpful to read the comments of others - thanks everyone! We had two cups of seeds so I upped the butter a bit and upped the salt even more - used garlic salt instead of Mortons. I learned from others that it is VERY important to keep your single layer single in order to get the nice toasty seeds - and even then, ours took a longer than 45 minutes on two cookie sheets. We just watched until they were toasty brown - and they are SO DELICIOUS! Thanks and happy Halloween! We've done pumpkin seeds since we were little and the only other thing that we add to the recipe is a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce. I did mine in vegetable oil and seasoned salt and also pepper. I cooked them for 10 minutes at 350.The butter burns the seeds especially after 45 minutes!!!!! So easy very tasty and  I  also used a little  Tajin seasoning teens loved itThank you We could use more salt Why do you people post a reviews with changing the entire recipe? Please post your own. I love this recipe.  Thank you poster for taking the time to post your own.  I grow my own pumpkins in Florida and feed my dog the pumpkin.  I eat the seeds.  Great recipe . These were ok. I loved the tip for separating the seeds. It was great. I think I need to punch up the flavor next time. It seemed to be lacking. They turned out golden brown and so tasty! I love Pumpkin Speeds They came out fantastic!!!
