Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating. Fold in coconut flakes with a spatula. Use 2 teaspoons to place little mounds of coconut mixture 2 inches apart onto the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the cookies. Allow to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes, then carefully transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely.
I had sweetened coconut flakes so I just omitted the sugar. The timing and temperature on this was perfect! My friends loved it and so did I. So easy! So fast! Makes a big batch and they are delicious! I was unsure what the texture would be like. Mine came out chewy on the outside and soft, moist and fluffy on the inside. YUM! These are so yummy, my mom and I ate about half of them as they came pit of the oven. I had sweetened coconut flakes so I just omitted the sugar. The timing and temperature on this was perfect!
