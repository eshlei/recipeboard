How simple and so very good!!!  My whole family loved it and I will be making this often!  Thank you so  much for the recipe! So simple yet so delicious. The mayo kept the chicken moist and the flavor of the cheese and breadcrumbs brought joy to our palettes. I served it with broccoli over whole wheat spaghetti with olive oil, S & P and parm cheese! Delicious meal. Made this with 7 chicken breasts. Doubled the ingredients. Added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and dijon mustard to the mayo/cheese, and used panko bread crumbs instead of Italian. Baked for 30 minutes instead of 20, and it came out great! Served with cheesy mashed potatoes and garlic green beans.
