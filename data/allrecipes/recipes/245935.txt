Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Slice bread rolls horizontally without separating into individual rolls, creating 2 even halves. Whisk eggs in a large, shallow bowl until smooth. Stir in milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to make a smooth batter. Dip bottom half of bread rolls into batter, coating both sides, and place in baking dish. Cover bread with sliced bananas. Sprinkle brown sugar and pecans on top. Dot with cubes of butter. Dip top half of bread rolls in batter, coating both sides, and place on top. Bake in the preheated oven until middle is set and top is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
I didn't have the rolls, so I substituted Italian bread, sliced about 1/2 inch thick, 12 slices. I added 2 tablespoons of banana liqueur like I use when making bananas foster. I topped it as suggested with pecans and brown sugar, and it was excellent. My wife gave it two thumbs up. This is such a yummy recipe!! I used French bread since that's what I had (and omitted nuts since my family won't eat them). The flavor is fabulous, and the bananas are so tender. This is the perfect way to batch make french toast so everyone can have breakfast or brunch at the same time!
