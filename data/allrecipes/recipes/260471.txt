Made as written except that I didn't need the water. Great breakfast for dinner recipe! Only let the eggs go for as long as the recipe states. They still looked too runny to me so I let them go longer and they ended up overcooked. Lesson learned. I would double the paprika next time but that is the only change I would make. I discovered that my potatoes were not good when I cut into them, so I found some french fries in the freezer and used those, since I'd already started the dish and it was too late to abort the process. I fried them in the skillet with the onions in the bacon drippings, and skipped the water. I did have to flip this over as the yolk wouldn't set and I don't like runny yolk, so it wasn't pretty, but it tasted fine. I would not use french fries the next time, but I didn't have hash browns or fresh potatoes, so I worked with what I had. They were fine, but they were preseasoned and a fresh potato would have taken on the flavors better and yielded a slightly better texture. Overall, this was a pretty good dish, and I wouldn't hesitate to fix it again, even with the frozen crinkly cut fries if that's all I had. I'd skip the garlic though. we substituted sausage for bacon and used 2 Tbs. bacon grease and it was amazing! Made as is EXCEPT microwaved 3 potatoes, cut them up which cut down the cooking time needed and just a tablespoon of water added not 1/4 c. Cracking the eggs one at time, not fussing too much then seasoning w/ salt & pepper needs to be quick as eggs are cooking FAST covered 5 min but sooooo worth the time needed to whip this up anytime.Thank you Dorinda ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¥˜ Really good. I used thawed southern style hashbrowns and minced an onion to add to it. I also used kielbasa style sausage - sliced in coins vs bacon but followed the cooking order as stated in the recipe (sausage, removed and added onions/hashbrowns). I also added just a smidge more smoked paprika.  You have to be able to move quickly in steps 6-8 so I suggest you phone a friend to have alongside you. Remember- the clock starts on the first egg so you need to crack and drop quickly without breaking the eggs + adding salt, pepper, meat and  cheese (which I omitted the cheese due to personal preference). The 5 min time is spot on for my eggs. Served with sliced avocado and hot sauce/salsa. Overall, we liked! Thanks Dorinda Medley! I cooked it less than the 20 min. in the instructions, otherwise the potatoes would have turned to mush.  I liked this breakfast skillet overall, but prefer the potatoes to be crispy.  This recipe had good flavor though, I would probably make it again. I've been making this breakfast for near 50 years.  If you beat the eggs and add a little cream. Pour it over the potatoes and add a little green pepper. Bake at 350F for approximately 15 to 20 min. Add a pinch of cayenne or serve with hot sauce or even sausage gravy. Now you have a 5 rating... It was perfect for a good start to the day.  I added sweet potatos instead of all regular potatos. It added more flavor and better health for a diabetic.  But either way a must for family! I used seasoned shredded potatoes and it came out awesome. Great recipe for a Sunday brunch! I used ham instead of bacon.
