Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with a rack in the center position. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring often, until browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon, reserving 2 tablespoons of the drippings. otdash Meredith Food Studio Add onion and bell pepper to drippings in skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add ground beef and sausage. Cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and drain fat, if desired. Stir in soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper. Stir in corn, bacon, and 1/2 cup of the cheese. otdash Meredith Food Studio Sprinkle top evenly with remaining 1 cup cheese and arrange tots in concentric circles over cheese layer (there will be about 1 1/2 cups tots leftover; reserve for another use). otdash Meredith Food Studio Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and beef mixture is bubbly, about 35 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.
I liked it a lot! My daughter doesn't like bacon and she ate her entire plate. I used mixed veggies because my daughter doesn't like peas. It was easy to make and had great flavor. This recipe was so easy to make and it was fantastic!  We couldn't wait to have leftovers (which, of course, were better than the 1st time)! My wife and I loved it.  Will definitely be making this again as soon as it cools off in October I personally did not think the overall rating of this meal was worth the high rating given. I substituted red pepper for green. And no hot sausage, sweet was used. The rest was easy and delicious.
