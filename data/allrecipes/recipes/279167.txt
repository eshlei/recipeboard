Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray. Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Add potatoes and toss to coat. Place potatoes, skin-side down, in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 23 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven; stir. Mix together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, onion flakes, paprika, parsley, and oregano in the same large bowl until well combined. Add sausage, green beans, bell pepper, and onion; toss until evenly coated. Add sausage mixture to potatoes on the baking sheet; spread out in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and potatoes and sausage pieces are browned, 20 to 25 minutes, tossing halfway through the cook time.
I used herbes de provence instead of the rosemary (since that's what I had, and it contains rosemary) and cut the chopped onion in half, still had plenty of onion. Not sure why the recipe calls for dried onion flakes when you are adding chopped onion in the same step, I will probably leave out the dried onion next time. But over all, very good and very easy. I added cauliflower abd paprika! Fast to prep. Easy and tastes great! Went heavier on the seasoning. Also added garlic powder. Otherwise followed recipe. Delish! I followed the recipe exactly.  We liked this recipe very much!  It was easy and tasty.  I do feel that next time I will use less oregano.  I thought it was overpowering, so I will half it next time. @🤔👀👍✌️✊🫵💯🔥❤️‍🔥 I made this recipe nearly as written. I used dried rosemary and eye-balled the amount of olive oil. My entire family ate this and liked it! Based on other reviews I used the biggest pan I had and honestly I probably should have just split the recipe into 2 pans instead. It makes a ton! Loved it ❤️… Had Italian sweet sausage and can green beans on hand and worked perfectly, after I browned the meat I added water to the frying pan to cook low simmer… when adding greenbeans and the sausage I poured the drippings from pan over it YUM ❤️… I always double up on the spices because that what we like … Thanks for great recipe Awesome
