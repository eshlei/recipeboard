I roast pumpkin seeds on a regular basis, and I always use this recipe now that I have found it. I must warn you: the more spice mixture you use, the better they are! The perfect balance for me is actually quadruple the mixture and still 2 cups of seeds. Also, for the salt I use 1/3 regular salt and the rest seasoned salt and they are soooooooo good! Thanks for the recipe! I love anything with Worcestershire sauce! And these pumpkin seeds will be on repeat!! So easy and delish! Loved this recipe. Added smoked paprika. I’ve made this several times and each time they are gone quickly. My family loves them. I rinsed and clean the pulp off the seeds and let dry over night. Well actually a few days busy schedule. Double and Used olive oil only 1/2 tsp of salt , garlic powder instead of the garlic salt to my 4 cups of seeds. Delicious! I have made this a couple times.  I keep the basic instructions and ingredients, butter and Worcestershire.  Then change the seasoning Taste was great, texture was not. Will follow other’s tips for throughly drying the seeds before throwing them in oven next time. This was delicious! Made as directed except only cooked 30 mins I followed this recipe for my acorn squash seeds and it worked perfectly thanks for the recipe Used  seasoned salt, garlic powder, olive oil...yum!!! The only thing that I did differently was to boil the cleaned, dried seeds in salted water, then dried before following the recipe. Spot on delish!
