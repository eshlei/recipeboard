Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Beat egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl until sugar has dissolved. Whisk water and pandan paste until smooth; mix thoroughly into egg yolk mixture. Stir in corn oil, then fold in sifted flour. Fold egg yolk mixture gently into beaten egg whites using a spatula. Pour into a 9-inch chiffon cake mold. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Invert cake mold onto a cooling rack immediately after removing it from the oven. Let cake cool upside down in the mold. Loosen cooled cake from the mold using a sharp knife.
