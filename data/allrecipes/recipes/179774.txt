Whisk the vegetable oil, vinegar, and sugar in a small bowl. Place the lettuce in a large bowl. Drizzle the oil mixture over the lettuce and toss to coat.
A very simple oil and vingegar mixture to liven up your mixed greens! I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and cut back on the sugar. I also added a little salt and cracked black pepper. I used a mix of romaine and butter lettuce to toss this with and this is a great base to add whatever veggies you like. Added some cucumber, husband liked that but said salad was nothing to write home about. Just OK. Simple and very good!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a nice way to eat up some of our leaf lettuce from the garden. Have way too much lettuce and was looking for differant ways to dress it up.
