Air Fryer French Toast Sticks

Mix eggs, milk, butter, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Line an air fryer basket with parchment paper. Dip each piece of bread into the milk mixture and place in the basket. Make sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Preheat the air fryer to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C). Add basket and cook bread for 6 minutes; flip and cook for 3 minutes more. Sprinkle each stick with confectioners' sugar.
I am the submitter of this recipe but when it was published the original serving of 2 was changed to 12. Yes, you will have 12 sticks from 4 slices of bread but not 12 servings. Yes, this was a good recipe, my air fryer needed to be around 400 though to get the outside cooked enough to be crispy. What I will do next time is crush some frosted flakes or just corn flakes and dip the stix in that and then spray with cooking spray and then air fry. Came out great, just leave room between pieces. I'll make again--soon! I used a glass pie plate and whisked ingredients together. I recommend allowing melted butter and milk to come to room temperature before adding vanilla and cinnamon. We loved it. Very crispy outside and soft inside. Soo good! I didn't even get to take a pick because we finished them all really quick. Lol Very tasty, nice and crisp, inside nice and soft, very easy to make. I thought I would test the air fryer against the skillet so one small slice was made in the skillet. When I compared them I liked the one in the air fryer better because it was more crisp but yet the inside was soft. Thank you for the recipe. This turned out perfect in my Big Boss Air Fryer! Very easy & yummy! Grandkids loved them! Not sure how to keep the cinnamon from clumping up though...I whisked & whisked but could not get the clumps out. I think next time I will just sprinkle the cinnamon on top of them once I put them in the basket.
