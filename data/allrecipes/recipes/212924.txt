Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with enough aluminum foil to cover the whole bangus. Remove scales and gills from bangus. Wash the innards. Pat fish dry with a paper towel. Mix tomato, onion, and 1/3 of the ginger together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cut open the front side of the fish and fill with the tomato mixture. Place fish in the prepared pan. Mix calamansi juice, soy sauce, garlic, and remaining ginger in a separate bowl. Pour over the fish in the pan. Fold foil over the fish and seal all ends. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 60 minutes.
Sarap po ng luto nyo. Nagustuhan ng mga bata. Suggestion ko lang po sana wag na imperial units ang gamitin natin metric nalang po. Hindi na po dapat ginagamit ang imperial units kasi outdated na. Salamat po I've never made Filipino food before and this was also my 1st time making milk fish. I found the number of bones to be ridiculous. I purchased a whole one (frozen) and was alarmed to find it had not been scaled or gutted.  Be prepared to have scales everywhere!  I substituted the juice of a large lemon instead of calamansi but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  The recipe has interesting asian notes and have never had tomato or onion stuffed fish but found it refreshingly different.  I would make again but with a different fish, maybe tilapia or similar.  Hint: Be sure to use tin foil wider than the standard 12" width to get a good seal.
