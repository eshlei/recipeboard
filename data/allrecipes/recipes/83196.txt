Cheesy Hamburger Rice Casserole
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/83196/hamburger-jazz/
Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice. Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of cheese. Broil until the cheese is melted and toasty. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!
My family loved it. I modified it by adding onions, bell pepper and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce as well as using minute rice. I also went the mega easy route and made it a one skillet meal by melting the cheese on top of the dish on the stove. I did not use the oven. Even better "left-over"! Rather bland & the consistency was not that appealing. I used 1 cup cooked rice stirred in and cooked about 5 min.  I used mozzarella and Mexican blend. I added 1/4 chopped onion, 1 tsp  garlic powder.  My kids said it looked ok but tasted amazing!  I will be making it again. Not this time, but I may add bell pepper next time.  I added the cheese stove top.  I used Ben's long grain and wild rice because I need to use it up. I'll try it again but next time I'll cook the rice first. I may add some taco seasoning to the ground beef too. Wasn't to bad.  I think I liked it more than the family.  Willing to try it again with tweaks.  I did use all the mozzarella, 8 oz, versus the amount listed. Pretty good, especially with additions many mentioned by others such as Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, mushrooms and onions.  I didn't have rice, so used left over spaghetti noodles, which worked well.  For cheese, I used white cheddar and parmesan under the broiler. Should explain if rice goes on bottom, top or seperate
