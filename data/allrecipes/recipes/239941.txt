Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Stir rice flour, soy flour, tapioca starch, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl. Beat margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat brown sugar into the margarine until incorporated and the mixture lightens in color. Add eggs one at a time, thoroughly beating each egg into the mixture before adding the next; add pumpkin and vanilla with the third egg. Gradually blend the dry mixture into the wet mixture until you have a batter; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
Great tasting bars. Very moist Bars, to me, have a crust on the bottom.  I would call this pumpkin cake because they do not (which I unfortunately found out too late.).  Also please include regular baking time. Stating in the comments that you used a convection oven leaves the rest of us having to experiment ,which is not what I wanted to do the day before Thanksgiving, LOL. This was great! I had the necessary flours and baked it in a conventional oven for 45 minutes. Nobody knows itâ€™s gluten free, except for those who need to know!
