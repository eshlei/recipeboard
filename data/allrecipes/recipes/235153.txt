Easy Baked Chicken Thighs
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235153/easy-baked-chicken-thighs/
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place chicken thighs in a baking dish; season both sides with garlic powder and onion flakes. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). abeveryda
I've used a similar recipe for years. 30 minutes at 350 degrees won't do it, however. I do 45 minutes at 450 and get a nice crispy skin. Little remains of the fat, and the thigh remains tender and juicy. This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and it is definitely a keeper. Great place to start if you want to play with flavors or just keep it simple. I found that I needed to bake a little longer at 375F than 30 min but that may just be my oven. Always helpful to have a cooking thermometer on hand! Thanks for a great go-to recipe! Paerfect , just what I wanted 😃 We cook for two and this recipe couldn't be easier for 2 or any number of guests. We added the usual s&p, no other changes. 🫶🤟word.

Easy to make, and if you follow the cooking directions (375 degrees NOT 350), it will be done in 30 minutes.I added a little smoked paprika and it was delicious. Easy recipe!! Easy to remember
