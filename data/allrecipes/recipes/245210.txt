https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245210/prosciutto-wrapped-pork-tenderloin-with-crispy-sage/
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet. Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes. Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves.
Used bacon instead of prosciutto Followed it exactly as written; hubby & I loved it.  Only change I will make next time will be to shorten the bake time a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe! The time was WAY off, but the meal was great. I had to cook more than double this time in the oven. The quoted time would only work for a very thin pork loin. Overall, great flavor. The sage works well with this. Nice meal, my family loved it ! Not sure where the 20 mins came in, itâ€™s been in there for 45 mins now and reached 150 since I like it more well done but man.. Sooo good! Used bacon instead of prosciutto This is a great quick recipe, delicious and moist. I just added a drizzle of balsamic reduction. Delish!
