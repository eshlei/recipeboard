Chicken Florentine Dip
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286044/chicken-florentine-dip/
Combine condensed soup, chicken, sour cream mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup skim milk, and Parmesan cheese in a slow cooker. Add spinach, pulling it apart and shredding it as you put it in. Mix until well blended. Cover and cook on Low until all cheeses are melted and the dip is deliciously gooey, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add up to 1/2 cup more milk if you feel the dip is cooking up too thick.
