https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17303/taco-pie/
Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay crescent dough flat on the bottom of a 9-inch square pan and bake according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in taco seasoning. Spoon beef filling into prebaked crust; add a layer of sour cream and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Top with crushed nacho chips. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.
I have a recipe similar to this but used flour tortillas.. I baked my cresent rolls about 4 minutes under time. I included ro-tel & onion in my meat then taco seasoning. I layered mine as follows: rolls, white cheese dip,meat,ranch style beans, sour cream, mexican style cheese then nacho doritos. Last 3 minutes covered with foil so the chips would not burn.. Make sure you SPRAY your glass dish, I did mine in a 9x13.. MMMMM family LOVED it! Will make this again. Ole! Muy Rico!!The flavors were great, the timing to cook was short and the simplicity for beginner cooks and busy parents ideal!!!I used 80/20 hamburger, so the draining of grease was necessary.I did make a few additions of ½ a white onion chopped, and 2 oz Hatch green chiles.  For fun and flavor, I garnished with an avocado slice and cilantro.  I didn’t want to add or change much as the recipe was easy-breezy just as is.Loved it!!!! I made  this Taco Pie recipe but added a few ingredients .  I added a can of Rotel to the meat mixture when it was almost all browned.  I added a layer of refried beans on top of the meat mixture in the dish before the sour cream.  When I served it, I put sliced green onions and sliced black olives on the top and had mild salsa on the side to spoon over each slice for those who wanted it.  It was a big hit and I plan on making it again! We made ours a bit healthier if you’re looking to hit those macro goals. We did grilled chicken instead of ground beef and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (tastes just like sour cream!)  added tomatoes and olives and Quest protein tortilla chips! It was fantastic without the guilt! I added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes to the meat when I was filling the pie - otherwise it was very good! There was too much crescent roll it puffed up nearly to the top of the pan. I added black beans to the meat and on top of the sour cream I added sliced black olives! Otherwise it was good! Very, very easy to make and the crescent roll crust is delicious.  I think getting the roll of giant crescent roll dough and laying it out in a 13x9 pan would help even out the crust- it is too thick trying to place the 8 oz roll on the bottom of a 9" pan, and it is uneven in thickness.  If you are going to be eating the entire recipe in one sitting, than baking the chips on top will be fine; otherwise, you may want to just add the chips into the melted cheese mafter baking on what you will be eating and save the rest without chips until reheated.  I strongly suggest eating it in one meal if possible since heating it up later will still return a very soggy crescent roll dough in the bottom of your pan.  I use a medium to hot taco seasoning mix just for personal preference and I have discovered you can use light sour cream to bake this (and save yourself a few calories- this isn't diet food!).  There are many suggestions of add-ons for this recipe but, if you are looking for the truly super-easy and fast way, preparing it as written produces a lovely meal in and of itself.  Enjoy! This was absolutely delicious!  Great way to use up left over taco meat and fixin's. Well, wish I'd read the comments before I started. I would have added some stuff to it. Also, realized, too late, that I was out of sour cream and used mayonnaise as a substitute. I really love this Recipe but after reading these comments I think imma change it up & add to it some Rotel tomatoes, Onions, Garlic, Bell peppers (Green,Red&Yellow) ones for flavor and color, and also I'll add different cheese like Provolone, Colby & Monterrey, -instead Fiesta Blend- & also ill put in some sour cream, garlic and a taco season pack but ill do my own bread from scratch and after its DONE ill top it off with Parsley Flakes😋💯💪🏾🤞🏾🙏🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽 but when I do it ill do a video so I can show y'all how I cooked mines & thanks to ALL of these Lovely Recipes i get from off of here🥰🫡
