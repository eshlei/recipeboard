AWESOME, MEAT DOES FALL APART IF YOU COOK FOR 7 HOURS OR MORE. I DID 7 HOURS AND THEN I HAVE ALSO MADE IT OVERNIGHT. AWESOME, AMAZINGLY EASY AND DELICIOUS! I CAN'T COOK ANYTHING AND MY FAMILY BEGGED FOR THIS FOR A WEEK. IT IS AWESOME POURED OVER A BAKED POTATO W/ CHEESE AND SOUR CREAM. OR, SERVE WITH RICE OR MASHED POTATOES. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND DO SO EVERY TIME.  I've never had meat come out of a slow cooker as tough and dry as this. So disappointing. That is an awesome recipe!! I used a half a stick of butter to 1.35 pound and  I also used balsamic vinegar and olive oil and only used a bit of water instead of broth I put tons of garlic and used Lawrys seasoning and Celtic sea salt sweet potatoes and regular potatoes some carrots and onion  Brilliant Dish!!!!! I've been making and enjoying this for a long time but have made many changes over the years. I started making it with London broil but have since changed to 2-3 lbs of pork chops. It's cheaper and the meat comes out more tender. I also don't add water, instead I use 2 cans of cream of mushroom which is needed since I'm doubling the amount of meat/+veggies. I add a small bag of baby carrots and 2 onions  cut into rings. I also add way more seasoning, no measurements, just whatever I have, a dash of this, dash of that, a couple slices of butter and a pack of powdered brown or mushroom gravy. I put the onions (and garlic)on the bottom, seasoning, half the pork on top of the onions, dump 1 can of cream of mushroom, then the gravy powder. Lazily mix a bit. Next the bag of baby carrots, more seasoning. Finally add the rest of the pork on top of all that and the second can of cream of mushroom, spread until it covers everything. Cook on low for 6-8 hrs. Stir it all up and pull out the bones if they are bone-in pork chops. This fills my entire crock pot and feeds us for a few days. Usually I make some mash potatoes on the stove as well, the gravy from the stew pairs incredibly. Very tender! 6 hours is plenty tho- I cooked 6 hr 35 minutes and I think I would have liked it not so well done but not dry at all! The only change was I used 25% less sodium Campbells cream of mushroom soup. My husband suggested adding mushrooms next time. We had with baked potatoes and tossed green salad. If I did it again I don't think I'd add the extra water.  Other than that, fast simple and tasty!  I added mini potatoes to the crock pot with 4 hours left.  It's a good trick! Made this last night. It was so delicious and tender. Will definitely save and repeat. perfect recipe for dinner I've cooked this recipe the past two years for our Christmas dinner. It's so easy and so delicious!
