Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Add root vegetables to a large bowl and toss with oil, seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches as needed, spread out sticks in the air-fryer basket. Air-fry, turning or stirring halfway through, until sticks are tender and golden, about 18 minutes. Stir together yogurt, citrus zest, citrus juice, herbs, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl for the dip. Serve dip with veggie sticks.
Loved this. Beetroot was the favourite for me and my youngest, but we also did carrot and parsnip. Will make again. Loved this. Beetroot was the favourite for me and my youngest, but we also did carrot and parsnip. Will make again.
