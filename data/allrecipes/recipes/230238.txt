This was my first attempt ever at gingerbread. I refrigerated it for 1.5 days because I got busy, and the dough kept well wrapped in plastic wrap. YUMMY flavor--my 2.5-year-old and I both love them! I didn't have enough molasses on hand, so I used probably about 2 Tbsp of corn syrup to make up for what I was missing. It didn't seem to cause a problem. For the other gingerbread virgins out there, here is my advice: first of all, when you take the dough out of the fridge, it will seem rock hard. Don't panic, it softens as you roll it. Only roll out 1/2 at a time as it gets very soft, very fast. Second of all, don't forget to MOVE the cookies to a wire rack after 1-2 minutes as listed. I got busy with my toddler and forgot, and my first batch stuck pretty good to my cookie sheets. I had to be careful to not crack them to pieces when removing them. With the next batches, I removed them after 1 minute with no problems at all. Happy baking! Absolutely loved eating and making these delicious gingerbread cookies. I would make them again but my oven set my house on fire and Iâ€™m currently at a homeless encampment. I will make them again (this time with less sugar) once I rebuild my childhood home. Amazing! It was great. I stored dough for 3 days and came out perfect. I added 1 tsp of ground cloves. This recipe is very easy to follow and good! Crumbly and not a lot of flavor Oh my goodness...Best simply Best ever !!!
