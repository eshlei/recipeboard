Seven Layer Salad

For the salad: Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble and set aside. Place chopped lettuce in a large glass dish or bowl; top with a layer of red onion, peas, shredded cheese, cauliflower, and bacon. For the dressing: Whisk mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over salad and refrigerate until chilled.
I made this for a party recently and it was a big hit. The only change I would make is to layer the dressing in the salad instead of just adding it to the top. I’ve been making Leah's Seven Layer Salad for 15 years, and it’s always a hit! One of my favorite things is the dressing is an actual layer, which makes it so easy to assemble and serve. Every bite has a little bit of everything, and it’s become a staple at my family dinners. Read through the comments for some great ideas. This is really just a base. Never limit your layers to 7! I used vegan cheese, vegan mayo(chipole flavor),  vegan sugar, saitan in place of the bacon, ( I used vegan salad dressing the second time I made it) I used spinach in place of the ice berg lettuce. It turned out great I substituted the cauliflower with an apple and cuc., boiled eggs , it was amazing yes i did layer the dressing but it set up thick so i was dissapointed I loved the recipe!  The only change I made was that I used Olive Garden salad dressing instead of the dressing made here.
