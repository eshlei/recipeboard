Uova in Purgatorio (Eggs in Purgatory)
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/265087/uova-in-purgatorio-eggs-in-purgatory/
Heat oil in a skillet over low heat. Add garlic, olives, capers, and anchovy; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce and water, bring to a boil, and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Add parsley and season with salt. Gently add eggs directly into tomato sauce without breaking the yolks. Cook until eggs are just cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
I made this twice. First was in a pot but the eggs disappeared. Definitely use a skillet. I cut back the olive oil to about half. I would make it again with 4 eggs. Toast is a must. I broiled at the end for the tops to cook just a touch. Very fancy and rich in flavor! We really enjoyed this dish. I left out the olives - just a personal preference. Perfect for a weekend brunch or light dinner. I loved this recipe and yes I needed bread I did add salt and pepper. Ty for sharing!
