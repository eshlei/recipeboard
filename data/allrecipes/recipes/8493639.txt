Pulse sandwich cookies in a food processor until they reach a fine, sand-like consistency. Add in cream cheese, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Continue pulsing, scraping down the sides when needed, until a smooth, loose dough is formed. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, measure out about 20 even portions of the dough (about 1 tablespoon a piece) onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Move to the freezer for 10 to 12 minutes. When the dough is firm enough, roll each portion into a ball shape. Move back to the freezer to harden slightly for 8 to 10 more minutes. In a large, microwave-safe bowl, melt white chocolate chips in the microwave in 30-intervals second, stirring in between, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. Drop each pumpkin spice ball into the chocolate. Using two forks, fully coat the dough in chocolate, let it drain, then place it back on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Allow the truffles to cool to room temperature before topping with melted chocolate, caramel, or more pumpkin pie spice. Keep in the refrigerator until just before serving.
Easy to make and tastes like fall. Great pumpkin spice flavor! I put sprinkles on them since I made them after the Halloween season. I also used Ghirardelli melting wafers instead of buying white chocolate chips.  My only complaint is that the inside filling  becomes really soft after they sit out a very little bit. Much better straight from the frig. We made these as a trial and they came out super cute! perfect for Halloween - kids loved them. Will be bringing to kids school Halloween party
