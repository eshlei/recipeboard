Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Beat egg whites in a large bowl until fluffy. Fold in milk, butter, and honey. Add cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt, stirring slowly until batter is smooth. Fold in corn and green chile peppers. Scoop some batter onto waffle iron; cook until golden brown and crisp or until waffle iron stops steaming, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
This is an excellent savory waffle recipe. I did mix all the ingredients together and then fold in the egg whites instead of starting with the whites because that's how I think waffles are made. I used my waffle bowl maker and served a waffle bowl buffet with bacon, chicken, cheese, etc. Delicious! This is an excellent savory waffle recipe.

I do not care for cornbread but made this for my husband. I did take a nibble but left the verdict up to the husband. I didn't care for the corn but he liked it. The one thing we agreed on is that it could use a tad bit more sugar. Other than that, this was perfect! These are super fun and make a wonderful presentation.
