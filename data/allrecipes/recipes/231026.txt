I've been wanting my family to start liking Indian food but they've always found the curries to be a bit strong. This Recipe is perfect starting point. They all loved it. So here's my fiendish plan (as I laugh maniacally ): gradually over the next 5 years I'll add more and more curry powder and by the end of the 5 years they'll be begging for vindaloo! DELISH! I serve with onion & tomatoes, finely chopped boiled egg, banana & cream  sambals  and of course Mrs balls chutney prepare to enjoy Will make again, Maybe cut the cayanne a bit and increase the cumin a little. Could add more peas, maybe double This was actually really good. I used a little less cayenne and it was spicy enough for me. I also added the garam masala toward the end of the cooking time instead of after it was cooked.  The potatoes took a little longer to cook than stated but overall this was a great dish. Served with rice and saut√©ed baby bok Choy. I added a couple of handfuls of spinach.  I didn't have canned tomatoes so I added a bunch of chopped fresh tomatoes and some beef broth to make it wet enough to cook the potatoes.  It was delicious and just the right amount of spice. I think I'll go with a little less ginger next time, because it was a bit overpowering. Very nice heat from the cayenne and Serrano. Only used one (14.5 oz) can of tomatoes and felt th heat was enough. Most excellent with warm Naan. So flavorful with just the right amount of heat.  I made this 4 yrs ago then lost the recipe.  Fortunately it came up in my memories on FB today so I'm making it tonight! This is a favorite of ours! Easy to make and so flavorful. My hubby always goes for seconds. Loved the spice combination. Subtle hot.  Could not find Garam Masala so made my own.
