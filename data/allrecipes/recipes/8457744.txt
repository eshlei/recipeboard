Whisk olive oil, Worcestershire, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken cubes and stir to coat. Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Add flour to the chicken mixture and stir to coat until all liquid is absorbed. Place chicken in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 8 minutes. Using tongs, flip the pieces over. Spray tops with non-stick cooking spray and cook 8 minutes more. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and parsley over the chicken. Cook until cheese has started to melt, about 2 minutes more. Serve immediately.
No changes. A bit too salty so I will omit that next time. Very tasty recipe. Easy and quick. I didn't like it.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  I think the cooking time was perhaps too long.  My chicken was dry and tough.  Sorry, I wanted to like it, but no. Be sure that your 'garlic powder' is not 'garlic salt'. I also skipped the flour. Flavors were great, we served it with a Tzatziki sauce. We used precooked chicken so there was no need for the flour to soak up the liquid. Super easy. Tasty. I'll do it again. Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll cut down the cooking time. No changes.  A bit too salty so I will omit that next time.  Very tasty recipe.  Easy and quick.
