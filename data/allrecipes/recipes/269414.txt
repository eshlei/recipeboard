Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large mixing bowl. Cut in butter until mixture looks crumbly. Mix in cranberries, pecans, and orange zest until evenly distributed. Stir in eggnog. Turn dough out on a well floured surface and cut into 2 pieces. Keep sprinkling on flour if needed. Form each piece into a disk and gently pat each disk into a round about 6 inches in diameter. Sprinkle each disk with coarse sparkling sugar. Cut each round into 8 wedges using a bench scraper or sharp knife. Cut straight down through the dough so you shear the edges; this helps the scones rise. Don't separate the wedges. Transfer dough circles to the prepared baking sheet. Separate the wedges slightly; there should be about 1 inch between the wider edges. Bake in the preheated oven until scones are just beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.
Delicious! Will make again! A great way to use leftover eggnog. I made this recipe twice exactly as presented and it worked perfectly. The scones were a big hit with the people I shared them with.
