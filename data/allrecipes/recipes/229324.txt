Ground Beef and Cabbage
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229324/ground-beef-and-cabbage/
Place cabbage, tomatoes with juice, onion, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper into a Dutch oven or large pot over low heat; cook and stir until it begins to simmer. Add lean ground beef on top; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender and ground beef is cooked through, about 45 minutes.
When I told my Hubby we were having "Ground Beef & Cabbage" for dinner he looked at me like I was crazy. To our surprise, not only did HE like it, so did our very picky kids! I changed very little, which was to add Garlic to the cabbage mixture and used 2 cans of tomatoes as suggested by other users. I think if you were only to use a 1/2 head of cabbage, 1 can of tomatoes would be enough. Next time, I'm planning on making this w/ all the ingredients listed, garlic, 2 cans Italian diced tomatoes and 1/2 lb Italian Sausage. This is a super-easy, budget-friendly, hearty meal for your family and it tastes great to boot! Don't forget a pinch of red pepper flake & some TX toast on the side! Yum! Thanks for sharing! I added 4 oz of ready mades tomato sauce for a little more zip. I thought it was a nice and easy, quick to prep idea. It was okay as presented but the 2nd time I made it I added some minced garlic, smoked Paprika, and cayenne to it for a little bit of bite. Now it's wonderful For those who enjoy quiet, non-spicy foods, this recipe is good.  For me though, I found the recipe boring.  Next time I'll add something spicier and use different flavors. Flavorful recipe, could've had more liquid-sauce. I browned the beef first with the seasonings and tomatoes/onions. Garlic clove minced added some depth. Added whole okra and cut up slices of sausage. I followed others suggestions adding  extra can of diced tomatoes.  I seasoned to taste and used ground Bison .  DELICIOUS and. EASY!  Thanks for the recipe. Really good!
