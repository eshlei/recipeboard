Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or use a parchment liner. Place chickpeas on a paper towel-lined plate to dry, patting down with another paper towel on top. Add dried chickpeas to a medium bowl, drizzle with avocado oil, sprinkle with Tajin, garlic powder, and cayenne, and toss to coat. Transfer chickpeas to the air fryer basket, and cook, stirring or shaking halfway through, until you reach your desired crispness, 12 to 15 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on the brand and size of your air fryer. Season with salt and allow chickpeas to cool slightly. utzflca
I didn’t have avocado oil so used olive oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I think I would add more tajin next time since I didn’t get a lot of flavor. The best thing about this recipe is the crunch factor. It makes a good crunchy afternoon snack and it’s good on a salad in place of croutons. Definitely a way to up the nutrition factor. I tried with Peanuts & they came out very yummy, Even Paneer Tikka also comes out very well I didn’t have avocado oil so used olive oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.
