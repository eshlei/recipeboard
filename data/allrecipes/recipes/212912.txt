https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212912/beef-nilaga/
Place short ribs into a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then boil for 5 minutes; the ribs will not be fully cooked. Drain and discard cooking water. Return ribs to the pot. Pour in 1 quart water, then add onions, peppercorns, and bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Skim any fat floating on the surface. Stir in potatoes, chayote squash, carrots, and celery. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt, then add cabbage and cook for 5 more minutes.
Really good for short ribs. I dredged the ribs in flour and browned them first, threw it all into a slow cooker and added bay leaf and garlic powder. This is a great Filipino recipe. The real authentic way to eat this is over rice and to have patis aka fish sauce on the side so the dish isn't so bland. This is a very bland dish. I prefer adding chunks of plaintain, not chayote.  Adds another dimension to the broth. Also like napa cabbage or bokeh choy.  If you cook the beef long enough, bouillon is not necessary. Soup bones are ideal. Really good for short ribs. I dredged the ribs in flour and browned them first, threw it all into a slow cooker and added bay leaf and garlic powder. I added garlic salt and seasoned salt after it was cooked.  It made the dish much tastier.  If you don't "doctor" it a bit, it is incredibly bland.  That being said, the fresh veggies were wonderful.  Meat was just so-so.
