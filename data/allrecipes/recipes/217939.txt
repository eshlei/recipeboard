Sounds like what my mother used to make but she added cheese to hers. My Polish grandmother made this. I love it. She is gone now 38 years now and I am sure she would be proud to know that I still make it for my family. Just like Momma made! I've had this before and was looking for the recipe. I'm going to give you 3 stars for not making me scroll down a mile to get the recipe and 2 stars for the delicious salad. It's so frustrating to have to scroll down and down and down to get to the recipe. Sometimes I'm in a hurry and can't take time to read the mile long story of how they got the recipe and blah blah. Thank you for making it easy. I have been trying to find a recipe for pea salad my friends mother makes.  This is incredibly close,  and  just "down-home"  delicious all the same.  It is usually the first bowl empty at the bbq! In my family that's bragging rights for sure. My husband loved this simple recipe.  I put shredded cheese on the table if someone wanted to add it.  Just let me his momma used to make It is simple and great with chicken I've tried this and love it. I usually add Garlic Powder to mine An old standby from childhood.  We had garden fresh peas this week and it was a great way to use them. so-so - i won't make it again.
