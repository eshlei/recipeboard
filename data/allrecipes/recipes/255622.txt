Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix flour, white sugar, cinnamon sugar, nutmeg, and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, pumpkin butter, and canola oil in a bowl until eggs are lightly beaten. Add flour mixture and mix until flour is no longer visible. Pour into the prepared loaf pan; sprinkle toffee bits on top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Needs, at least, salt. Since the previous review said they tasted bland I space them up a bit
