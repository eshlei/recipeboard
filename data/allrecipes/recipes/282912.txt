Banana Pudding with Ladyfingers
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/282912/banana-pudding-with-ladyfingers/
Combine milk, eggs, and egg yolks in a medium saucepan over low heat. Beat well and heat until hot to the touch but not boiling, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Combine sugar and salt in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Slowly add milk mixture, stirring frequently. Cook and stir, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until smooth and as thick as heavy cream, 8 to 10 minutes. Add butter, vanilla, and almond extract; stir until butter melts. Strain custard mixture through a sieve into a large bowl. Lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface and place in the refrigerator until completely cooled, at least 2 hours. Slice bananas into 3/4-inch thick pieces. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with orange juice. Arrange 1/2 of the ladyfingers in the bottom of a trifle bowl. Arrange 1/2 of the banana slices over the ladyfingers and pour 1/2 of the cooled custard over top. Repeat layers once more. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.
Ladyfingers are so much better in banana pudding! So glad I tried this recipe. Thank you!
