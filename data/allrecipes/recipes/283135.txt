Old-Fashioned Hamburger and Vegetable Stew
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/283135/old-fashioned-hamburger-and-vegetable-stew/
Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and cook ground beef until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add onion and celery and cook, stirring, until onion is soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in beef stock and stir, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add carrots. Tie parsley, rosemary, thyme, and sage together into a bundle with cooking twine and add to the pot. Add bay leaf and season soup with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for about 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium and add potatoes, green beans, corn, and drained tomatoes. Return soup to a boil, partially with a lid so steam can still escape, and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, about 25 minutes. Remove herb bundle and bay leaf and discard. Adjust salt and pepper, if needed.
Delicious and nutritious!  It was fun and easy to put together and I loved using the herbs from my garden, used oregano instead of thyme. (Why did I not think to plant thyme?) It was a great way to use up the odds and ends in the fridge too. Has so many possibilities.  A great “go to” recipe. This is a very flavorful soup. My family loved it. This was a good recipe! It used spices I wouldn't have thought to use! My Grandma would've called this a 'kitchen sink' recipe, having everything in it but you know! And by simply swapping out chicken bullion for the beef stock, even more possibilities!  A nice change though since we were getting 'chicken'd out'!
