I travel frequently and often have Cobb Salads when I do - on planes, in restaurants, hotels and even from grocery stores. I love a good Cobb Salad, but I never much paid attention to what I know is a classic list of ingredients. So glad to find this recipe here, and this is quite easily the best Cobb Salad I've ever had anywhere, probably because I controlled the ingredients, their quality and their freshness. I stuck to the ingredients as written as, again, I recognize them to be critical to an authentic Cobb Salad. I did, however, make my own Buttermilk Ranch Dressing. This was an ideal dinner to make for myself since Hubs is out of town and he would have never eaten this in a million years - well, not with the Blue cheese anyway. My tummy is happy. (Tip: Penzey's Spices makes a seasoning blend called "Buttermilk Dressing and Dip" which makes a quick but awesome ranch dressing! I don't even use buttermilk - just sour cream, mayo and half and half to desired thickness) This Cobb salad is a super hot in my home. Just made it again for 3rd time! Loved it! SO easy to make too!! Delicious and very filling Perfection. Made this for my parents. we all really enjoyed it!
