Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Rinse the pumpkin seeds and pat dry. Place them in a bowl. Add the Worcestershire sauce, melted butter and seasoned salt; stir until evenly coated. Spread out in an even layer on a baking sheet. Bake for about 1 hour in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until crisp, dry and golden brown.
This is a fantastic variation of the typical roasted/kosher salted seeds. Be sure to soak the seeds (I soak overnight) so they absorb some of the liquid and become plump and less splintered. You can also add Soy for an added kick! Great recipe. Delicious. Made exactly as directed!!! We made these exactly lik the recipe said and they came out perfect!! I loved it, they were the best pumpkin seeds ever! Delicious. Added some additional spices because we did not have seasoned salt. Loved these exactly as the recipe showed. Yum! The best pumpkin seeds I’ve ever made! I didn’t soak them overnight but they did take a little longer to cook and dry out than the recipe said. They were perfect!! I didn’t like the smell of the Worcestershire sauce while roasting so I expected to not like the finished product. But shortly thereafter I can’t keep my hands off of them. So good.  Sidenote: I got some lemon essential oil on my hands a little later when i took a handful of the seeds. I think I would actually love to try this recipe with the slightest hint of lemon. Followed the recipe. Be careful not to over bake them. Easy to add or subtract. Lots of possible variations!!! These turned out great!! Not too salty or chewy, perfect!
