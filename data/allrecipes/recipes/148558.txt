Fill a cocktail shaker with ice; add vodka, apple schnapps, butterscotch schnapps, and cranberry juice. Cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a chilled glass and garnish with marachino cherry.
These are very popular here in Washington. Whenever I go out, I make sure to order one of these for an after dinner drink. When I make them at home, though, I do make them a little stronger.So good.  This drink is a perfect combination of sweet and tart. Perfect cocktail for the holiday season. Fun to make-n-shake and sweet on the tongue!If you love sweet drinks this is perfect for you.If you enjoy a more flavorful martinis add the juice of one whole lime and use “just cranberry” juice without sweetener.Also, I used a slice of green apple for a bit of sour flavor and color rather than a maraschino cherry. I will definitely make this again....... very good!!! I changed the butterscotch with a cherry pucker.  Now that's a candy apple martini !!! This is a great combination of flavors.  I discovered I was out of the Sour Apple when I had already started so used Apple Stoli instead.  I think as a result of that we ended up adding 1/2 of another cranberry juice.  The butterscotch was not overwhelming for us - rather gave a warmth and richness to the flavor of the drink.  By the end of the drink, however, it was losing some of its appeal.  Good, but not great for us. ***** I fell in love at the thought of it and then WOW! Nothing else will do. I little less on the butterscotch tough. In my opinion about 1/2 oz. Best martini I've ever had! These were great. Even the people who do not drink martinis liked them. I served a slice of apple on the glass. Great twist on the plain Appletini.  This is my new favorite drink.
