Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add sausage; stir to break up lumps and cook until lightly browned and crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add undrained tomatoes, water, basil, oregano, and parsley to the pan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, rinse under cool water, and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover the sauce and increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and add 2/3 of the sauce to pasta; toss to combine. Stir in mozzarella cheese and 1 cup Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish, pour remaining sauce over top, and cover with aluminum foil.. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan, and bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes longer.
Delicious! I used half mild and half hot Italian sausage and it was devoured by all! This was very well received at our family dinner last night.  I cut the recipe in half to serve 6 and we had one serving leftover. I used whole wheat pasta and half sausage, half ground beef.   I will definitely save to make again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! This was very good and easy to make. I chose to leave the sausage sliced instead of ground, but that was the only change I made. This easily fed 7 hungry teenagers.
