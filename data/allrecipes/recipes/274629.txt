Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, rosemary, and tarragon together in a measuring cup. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/2 of the oil mixture over the chicken and reserve the remaining 1/2. Using your hands, massage the oil mixture into the chicken skin. Season with salt and pepper. Grill chicken skin-side up over indirect heat for 50 minutes. Move chicken over direct heat and grill 5 minutes. Carefully flip chicken over skin-side down and grill until skin is brown and crispy, about 5 more minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes. Drizzle reserved oil mixture over the chicken. Carve and serve.
Wonderfully moist and flavorful chicken! True confessions, I did not grill my chicken but spatchcocked and oven roasted it instead. I used fresh oregano and rosemary from my garden. I put lemon pepper in with the other herbs and spread this on the chicken and put the lemon juice in the roasting pan with chicken broth, which made a fab sauce to lace over the entrees on the plate. Restaurant quality in my opinion! tender, flavorful and delicious! Been hunting for years. Finally found several for Greek chicken. Now I know where to go. Wonderfully moist and flavorful chicken!
