Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place Brussels sprouts and butternut squash in a single layer on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 25 minutes.
I used fresh minced garlic and it was a hit. Adding this to the dinner rotation Easy to make and good flavors. Any vegetable lover will enjoy this roasted dish Kids agree, this pairs well with the Parmesan-Crusted lemon Pepper chicken: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/280305/parmesan-crusted-lemon-pepper-chicken/ Great recipe!  Added some red pepper for some additional color, flavor, and texture.  Also added some Zatar seasoning to bring in a slight Mediterranean feel.  Will definitely make it again. Turned out really delicious and easy to make. I did roast them longer to get them tender. It took about 35 minutes for me. Will definitely be making this again this season. Loved the mix of brussels  and butternut squash, and the seasoning was great too. At 25 minutes, the brussels were getting rather dark and crispy, but that's how I like them - however this might be a tad long for some. I just needed to add a bit more oil to the mix, and then some salt at the end before serving. A nice autumn and winter side dish with very generous portions. I'll be making this again! This was good exactly as directed in the recipe.  We will definitely have it again. I tried this just with the sprouts and they came out great! I saw another reviewer mention fresh garlic instead of powder, but it burned, so next time I'll go with the powder just as the recipe calls for. I used fresh minced garlic and it was a hit.
