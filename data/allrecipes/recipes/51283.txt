Hi - this is Starflower and I submitted this recipe. Just wanted to let you know...you never marinate fish for more than 30 minutes! It is not like meat. Per professional chefs. This is so simple and the taste is amazing! I've made this several times now and we love it!!!Don't Change a Thing! Everyone loved it. The only note I made was a mental note to never cook salmon any other way unless making salmon cakes from a can! Every one loves this and it is requested frequently. I have had to make a few adjustments along the way, simply because I didn’t have enough of this so had to use a little more of than. The only major change I’ve made is to chop up a couple of mini sweet peppers and a green onion to go with the garlic. It makes it a little more colorful and my group loves sweet peppers. I could say a lot more but basically this is definitely a keeper!! Thanks so much for sharing. Great recipe. I use the marinade as a baste when grilling salmon on the barbeque. I made this with a friend & it turned out excellent!I will definitely make it again. It was easy & very tasty! Wonderful This salmon is amazing.  My 17 yr old loves it . I serve it with fried rice and broccoli or asparagus! It is so easy.  You could serve to company because the flavors are interesting enough.
