Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Mix together sugar, cornstarch, and flour; set aside. Combine cream cheese and cottage cheese; beat with an electric mixer at high speed until smooth and fluffy. Beat in softened butter. Gradually add sugar mixture, beating until combined. Add eggs one at a time, blending well and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Stir in lemon juice and vanilla and mix just until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Turn off the oven; let cheesecake rest in the oven with the door closed for 2 hours. Remove and cool on a wire rack. Chill for 4 hours or overnight.
I lived in Germany many years ago and loved eating cheesecake, but the cheesecake recipes in the US are very different. This recipe is the closest I've found to a traditional German cheesecake.  This recipe is almost exact to one my mother made each year for my grandfather,  until the recipe was lost. I only add a small amount of sour cream to the cottage cheese. High fat.. Thanks again. I now make this for my husband birthday.  Today.. Fantastic.  Loved it.  Creamy, with a hint of lemon.  I followed the recipe as it was written.  Would not change a thing.  Will make it over and over again. I've never tried German cheese cake, so I can't verify the authenticity of this recipe, but my husband said it's very close and even requested it for his birthday. I also enjoyed it, but my daughter did not as she's used to sweeter American cheese cake.  If you like a lighter sweetened dessert, this is for you! Subbed the cottage cheese out for ricotta (eight parts ricotta to one part sour cream, blended together) and made the best cheesecake I've ever had. Not too sweet, not bland, just the perfect cheesecake flavor. Will be making this my go to recipe in the future. I visited my son in Germany s a few years ago and aside from being amazed by the beauty of the country and its people, I was in awe my a delicious delight I discovered in a small bakery in Bonn. What a perfect partner to a morning cup of coffee as we headed out for a day of discovery.When I returned  to the U.S I think I missed the cheesecake more than I missed my son- and the hunt for that deliciousness began! Thank you  Miss Alix for sharing your recipe- and thank you Lizzy Reed for your awesome suggestion. I run the cottage cheese through the magic bullet and quark- magic happens!                                                  If you want to make it with less cane sugar and gluten free, you can substitute almond flour for flour and 1/3 cup of stevia and 1-2 Tablespoons of regular sugar. It is then friendlier for anyone who is avoiding sugar and gluten and it still tastes delicious! Again- thank you! I love this recipe, it reminds me of my grandmother’s. I’ve used quark, and when I can’t find that I’ve used the ricotta that comes in a container like cottage cheese which works as a great substitute. My grandma use to add a shortbread crust. Made this for friends one night while having a German themed dinner. Amazing flavor and not as sweet as American style cheesecake. Made it using Brownie Batter flavored quark that i found at Publix. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had! I took this to a German party for friends who have served missions, study abroad, exchange students, heritage, etc in Germany. Overall there were over 20 people there and this went over well and I was asked for the recipe.  I did puree all the ingredients together in the food processor instead of the electric mixer and it made the cake very smooth. I will make it again. Cheesecake goodness! I have eaten cheesecake's cakes all over Germany and this recipe is right on the money. It's light and fluffy that leaves you with the urge to have just one more slice. Only change I did was I used Linzertorte crust that was left over. Found it gave it that nice crisp texture and the almond flavor went well with the lemony flavored cheesecake.
