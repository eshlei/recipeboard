Sauteed Apples and Onions
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/283031/sauteed-apples-and-onions/
Melt butter in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add apples, onion, salt, cumin, and balsamic vinegar; sauté until onion translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
This recipe was suggested to me by Tammy when I asked a group how I could use some sausage that had apple and was billed as “French”. I had four sausage links and deceased two and cooked the crumpled sausage. Then followed the directions exactly and added the crumbled sausage back in. I served with egg noodles and the other two sausage links. The flavor was terrific and the mild “French Sausage” was a nice add! Thanks you!!! Started to get very brown before being cooked through, so I added some water to the skillet and  covered for a couple minutes.  The addition of cumin was the biggest surprise, and I liked the balsamic so much that I added a little more.  Nice recipe, will make again. I would never have thought to combine apples and onions, but this really works. It was fast to put together and I enjoyed eating it. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Wow, a Pan Full of Fall Flavors! A surprising side dish reminiscent of Thanksgiving and great anytime of the year.  This would be a good addition to any meat protein.  It’s fruity and savory at the same time.  It begs to be enjoyed with sauvignon banc or a rose. Loved this recipe: Substituted Curry Powder for Cummin and used a Yellow Onion..... it's delicious 😋 Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp finely-chopped candied ginger to a half-quantity of the recipe. Served it with pork chops. Delicious! The sweet-savory combination really works for me. This was very good!  My whole family enjoyed it. I’m not sure how I came across this recipe but I’m glad I did. I added impossible meat “ground sausage” and a lot more of the cumin and balsamic vinegar. I have a dark balsamic vinegar called Red Apple and it went very well with it. This is a great way to use your older apples and any kind will do. Be sure to use a sweet onion and cut like you would for stir fry in half moons. The cumin was a nice addition. I didn't have balsamic vinegar...just used apple cider vinegar & it was fine. I sliced some beef sausage links and browned them as a side to the apples. Served with a small side salad and garlic bread. very tasty meal with a different twist. Will make it again and share. Quick & easy.

I ate it with smoked sausage, and it was a wonderful lunch!
