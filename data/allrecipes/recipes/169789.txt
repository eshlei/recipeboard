I used plain lowfat or no fat yougurt rather than sour cream Best recipe I had to add about 1/2 tsp of white pepper, but the family loved it. Ezzee peezy if you have all the ingredients, which I had substituting Yogurt for Sour Cream, Vunder bar....take that you Donner folks...Voila ! ive been makin this for years now, it is an excellent base recipe as is but i feel ive perfected it. first,  mix 50/50 greek yogurt and sour cream.  cut out cucumber seeds and finely grate. omit mustard, not necessary,  add a lil quality olive oil and a pinch of s+p and viola,  perfection. also, fresh dill does make a difference Easy and adaptable! I used plain dairy free yogurt and adjusted the seasonings to taste. Will make again. We enjoyed this dip very much.  I used full fat plain Greek yogurt because it's what I had in the fridge. I actually had a little sour cream but not enough for the whole recipe so I just went with the yogurt. I used 2 fresh garlic cloves that I grated into the mix and I omitted the mustard because it doesn't belong in Greek gyro sauce IMHO.   I used  fresh dill,  and grated the cucumber.  It was very close to the dip/ sauce they serve at the Greek place close to our house.This is nice to have to put on gyros, Greek salad, which is what I used it for, or crudite. You can feel good about eating this and it tastes really fresh! The aftertaste of Greek yogurt is terrible.This recipe has the great flavor I was looking for.
