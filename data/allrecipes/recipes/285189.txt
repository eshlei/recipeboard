Place chicken at the bottom of a slow cooker and sprinkle chili seasoning over top. Add 1 can of white beans, chicken broth, salsa verde, corn, onion, celery, jalapenos, green chiles, and garlic. Cook on High until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the slow cooker, shred meat with 2 forks, and return to the pot. Puree remaining can of white beans in a blender or electric chopper; add to the chili. Stir and cook on High for 30 more minutes. Top with cilantro and serve.
This is easy and pretty tasty. It is a bit soupy, but my family really liked it. This is easy and pretty tasty. It is a bit soupy, but my family really liked it.
