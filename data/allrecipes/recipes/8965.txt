I made this tonight and was pleased with it. Even my SUPER picky 5 yr. old cleaned his plate!!! My husband who usually HATES casseroles liked it as well. This is what I did: I used 2 cans cream of chicken instead of 1 cream of mushroom, I used half a can of milk instead of mayo, I used chopped broccoli (comes frozen), and I cooked the stuffing mix before placing it on the casserole. I also mixed the soup, milk, chicken and broccoli before placing in casserole dish. I covered it with the cheese and then the cooked stuffing. It was good this way, but i will make some changes...I will use more cheese (maybe 2 cups), 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and use 2 boxes of stuffing mix instead of one. My 5 year old said he wanted more of the bread and i agreed. Oh, I boiled the chicken in chicken broth with a bay leaf. This is a good, quick meal. I am making a meal for a woman at my church next week and I will use this recipe. Excellent recipe, I used a bought rotisserie chicken and I added all the ingredients together and mixed well. Then added the stuffing crumbs on top with parmesan cheese.....delicious ðŸ˜‹ I followed this as directed and it was so dry. It did not fill out the pan. Put it in a smaller pan, put way more cheese, way more cream of mushroom(or chicken) soup, and mix the stuffing in because otherwise itâ€™s just dry crispy stuffing mix on top of a super dry blend. Bland and really lacking flavor. No way the prep time is only ten minutes! I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup, some sautÃ©ed mushroom slices, and mixed the bread with melted butter. I have been making this for years. We called it Chicken Surprise. The only differences were, I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and I. Made the stuffing with the stovetop method before putting it on top. Itâ€™s a favorite comfort meal to my family. It was pretty good.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, but would probably add a little milk next time  to thin out the sauce.
