Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Quickly shred butter into the flour mixture. Using a fork, gently work butter into the flour until it is the consistency of coarse crumbs. Whisk buttermilk and egg together in a small bowl and pour over the flour mixture. Use a spatula to combine until just moist. Gently fold in chopped apples, using your hands if necessary, until it just comes together. Do not over mix the dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, divide in half, and pat each half into a 5-inch circle. Using a bench scraper or knife coated with cooking spray, cut into 6 wedges. Place wedges, not touching, on the prepared cookie sheet Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes. Whisk confectioners' sugar, maple syrup, and cinnamon together until a smooth glaze forms. Drizzle over scones and garnish with grated nutmeg.
Make scones as per recipe but grated apples to be in the scones. Good taste. only glazed half the scones. Not a fan of the glaze. prefer no glaze next time. I made them just like the recipe.  They turned out great.  Not too sweet.  I love baked foods made with buttermilk.  My sister said best scone ever! These came out great!  One person said "Omg!! Delish! Literally the best scone I have ever had!!"  I may have made a little more glaze than the recipe called for and I did sprinkle on some freshly grated nutmeg! I followed the recipe as instructed and the scones came out moist, but not a whole lot of flavor, until we used about a tablespoon of apple butter on each one. Was great bunch finisher.
