To make the vinaigrette: Combine sherry vinegar, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and minced garlic in a small bowl; stir briskly. Whisk in olive oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, until well combined. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Add green beans and boil until beans are bright-green and tender crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Sieve out green beans and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain and place in a large bowl. Drain potatoes, cool slightly, slice in half, and add to the bowl with the green beans. Add bell pepper and drizzle vinaigrette on top; toss until vegetables are well coated. Line a serving plate with lettuce leaves and arrange prepared potatoes, green beans, and pepper strips on top. Evenly place olive halves around the salad. Lightly toss sliced cherry tomatoes with olive oil and salt; arrange around the plate. Place salmon on top of salad. Slice egg in half, and place one half of the egg on each side of the plate. Serve.
Everything in this salad is delicious but the dressing with the potatoes makes it spectacular. It disappeared quickly at a family party!
