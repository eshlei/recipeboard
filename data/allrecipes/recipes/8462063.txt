Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Slice halloumi into 6 equal slices, cut each slice in half, and dry with a paper towel. Brush all sides with olive oil. Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place the halloumi slices in the basket, making sure they're not touching. You may have to cook in two batches, Cook for 7 to 9 minutes until golden brown, but make sure not to overcook or they turn rubbery. Serve immediately.
So quick and easy to make. 8 minutes was perfect for my air fryer. Not rubbery at all. Thanks for the recipe my friend! This was a great recipe and so incredibly easy to do. Eight minutes was just right and the cheese was not at all rubbery. (And I was skeptical about the air fryer since I love grilled halloumi.) I will happily make this again and again--thanks.
