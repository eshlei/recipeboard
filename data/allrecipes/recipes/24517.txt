Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking pan. Stir together flour, cornmeal, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl; form a well in the center. Add cream, eggs, oil, and honey; stir until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
This IS the BEST cornbread on the site. I will look no further! I followed the recipe to the t, made no changes and it is perfect ('cept I had to cook it longer, but that's nothing). Everyone said this is the best cornbread I've made from scratch yet (and I've made over 5 already from this site with 5 stars and 200+ ratings). Thank you Tim! P.S. I don't get reviews that only give 4 stars when they themselves say it's, "the best". Beats me. I'm doing my best to replace seed oils.. So I swapped veg oil for butter. Amazing! 🔥 old school Corn bread! Made this camping in a 10 inch dutch oven. 17 charcoal briquettes on top and 10 on bottom.Baked for 30 minutes.  Perfection! Great taste and easy to make! I would like to note though that 25 minutes baking time was not enough, it was still slightly gooey in the middle. I added another 10 minutes and that was perfect. Nice recipe I made honey butter to go with it. Delicious. The vegetable oil taste was way too strong for us in this recipe. We couldn’t even eat it! I would maybe try it again with melted butter instead, but honestly I’ll probably just find another recipe. We couldn’t even eat it. I didn’t have regular honey, so I used “sweet heat honey” and it was delicious!! nice one My husband loves cornbread, but he said the flavor of the cornmeal was not as strong. He likes that cornmeal flavor. Maybe I’ll add more then a cup next time. He said it was ok.
