This cake is delicious! I took the advice of other reviews and used 3/4 c oil + 1/2 c applesauce. I also added more cinnamon plus nutmeg, all spice & cloves because I love spices. I used 1/2 splenda & 1/2 sugar, and it was great. Used a 9 X 13 pan and cake was ready in 35 min. Topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. Everyone is raving about it - thank you! I followed the recipe somewhat. however I did use fresh pumpkin instead of canned. I also added 1tsp of nutmeg and replaced some of the oil with apple sauce. Easy to make, I just mixed all the wet ingredients together in one go.  Very moist.  You could cut back a bit on the sugar and still have a good cake I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" x 8" pan.  Topped it with cream cheese frosting. Hubby and co-workers rated it a success. I made a Bundt cake.  55 mins @ 350 to bake. Minor changes just for taste. Upped cinnamon to 3 t. Added 1 tsp each of allspice and ginger.Used 1c coconut oil and 1/4 c apple sauce and 1 1/2 t vanilla.  Frost it with a cream cheese maple pumpkin spice glaze   Get raves on it every time! So moist not greasy at all. This is the best. Moist,  tasty and easy This was a great find and the cake turned out delicious and I’m not a baker. I added a bit of banana cream rum and finely chopped walnuts and baked it for 25 minutes. It seemed like a lot of oil in the mixer but it came out fine and wasn’t greasy. Also used whole wheat flour. I added some cream cheese icing to top it off. I've been making this recipe for years, always moist and delicious!I make this with whole wheat flour and add some nutmeg as wellI use half stevia and half regular sugar and there is no sweetener taste, in fact u can't tell at all! It's delicious! I only changed the walnuts to pecans because we prefer them.           Lana This cake was very moist and delicious! I used pecans because I'm allergic to walnuts.  I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.Loved it!  My husband loved it too!  Best recipe ever!
