Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well. Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes.
I like the flavor of the coating! I do have one suggestion. I tried applying the coating the way the recipe calls for (just dip in egg then coating), and also the way I learned in culinary school (dip in flour, then egg, then coating). The latter method was much better the chicken was crispier and much juicier. I will probably make again - thanks! I enjoyed making this recipe, I did switch the order of prep, by seasoning the chicken first with Adobo, and Sazon for some deep flavor. I floured the chicken first, egg dip second then the crumbs last. It made a much more crispier chicken. I made this except I used cheese crackers, (like Cheezits), and the family loved it. Its the most frequent chicken request I get for supper now. Great recipe, thanks for sharing us! Has anyone tried this exact recipe in air fryer? Love this recipe. Didnâ€™t change anything except the dipping method as suggested by other reviews. Have cooked by the frying method always and is delicious!! I've been making this recipe for YEARS.  Back in 2004 I started adding more spices and that sent this dish to the stars for tastiness.  I add:Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, a dash of red pepper flakes. It's delicious with mashed potatoes and collards. It tasted amazing! My family is very picky but they loved it. It was flaky and elicious! 100% recommend!
