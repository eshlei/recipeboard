Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Whisk apple cider, maple syrup, yogurt, applesauce, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and maple extract together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix in flour, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, salt, and nutmeg until incorporated. Fold in apples and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan and tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Allow bread to cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Gently run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen and turn loaf out onto a wire rack to cool.
I didn't have cardamom on hand so I made it without. I liked it, but definitely want to try it with cardamom. Wonderful hearty and healthy tasting quick bread.Used pecans instead of walnuts.Need a larger bread pan...used the recommended size and there was an overflow. This was one of the best breads I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, doubling it, and gave one loaf to my neighbor. She and her husband also loved it. Sometimes when making anything as healthy as this bread, I worry that it will not be tasty and miss the mark as a treat. Not so for this one! My advice is to use REAL maple syrup. This is a winner!
