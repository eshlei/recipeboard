Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put butter in 13x9-inch baking pan and place in oven until melted. Swirl to coat bottom and sides with butter. Spread graham cracker crumbs evenly over bottom of pan. Layer chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and walnuts over crumbs. Pour condensed milk over walnuts and sprinkle with coconut. Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool and cut into 36 bars.
These are great bars! I've tried several recipes for these bars and here's what I've learned (some after many failed attempts):1. Don't buy graham cracker crumbs. Use regular graham crackers and crush them yourself.2. If you have trouble with the butter not soaking through the cracker crumbs, combine them in a small bowl first and then pat them into the pan evenly. 3. The order of ingredients makes a difference in taste. This recipe puts the coconut on last which makes a great toasted coconut top. have made these for many years now and the only thing I change is using gluten free graham crackers Iâ€™ve made these exactly how the recipe says. But the graham cracker crust always ends up breaking up and half the crumbs end up in the pan. I welcome any suggestions so that this doesnâ€™t keep happening! I've made these every year for 40+ years. Super yummy! It's not the Holidays until I've made dozens and dozens! Easy and delicious!! Always a favorite around the holidays - we bring them to family gatherings and they're a big hit! Mom use to make every Christmas ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶ Delicious! Perfect! Just like Momâ€™s!
