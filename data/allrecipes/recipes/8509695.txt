Place butternut squash in a microwave-safe baking dish with a lid. Season with salt and pepper. Microwave, covered, until squash is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Coarsely mash with a potato masher or fork. Stir in pecans, maple syrup, blue cheese crumbles, and fresh thyme leaves until combined.
This is a really refreshing take on a favorite squash: butternut! The addition of the toasted pecans, bleu cheese and thyme gave it a true uplift! I would have liked more salt to offset some of the sweet, but that is a personal choice. I also would like to try it substituting honey for the maple syrup. It took NO TIME to bring together; making it an easy fix for a side dish. It does take a trip to the store, most items are not in my pantry. But, while there, I just bought more ingredients to use in a couple of other dishes.I truly loved this and highly recommend as a holiday favorite, or just as a favorite! In addition to roasting the squash in the oven I went with a bit less maple syrup and used dried thyme - 1/2t.  Nice accompaniment to chicken breasts.
