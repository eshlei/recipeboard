Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place potatoes and carrots in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and continue to cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in flour and thyme until combined. Slowly whisk in broth and milk until combined. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking continuously until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add chicken, peas, corn, and potato-carrot mixture. Place pie crust in the bottom of 2 pie plates. Fill each with 1/2 of pot pie mixture. Cover with remaining pie crusts. Cut slits on top of each crust, and press a fork around the edges to seal. Freeze second pot pie, if desired. Bake pot pie in the preheated oven until inside is bubbly, and crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
I've been making this for a couple of years now.  It is my favorite chicken pot pie and I love the fact that you make 2 and can freeze one!  The frozen one is just as good as the fresh! our kids loved this recipe! it was so creamy, easy to make, just an all-around crowd pleaser.
