Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and Italian seasoning in a bowl. Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes; drain. Stir in marinara sauce. Spread 1/6 of the cheese mixture evenly on each flatbread; cover with sausage mixture. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.
10.11.16 I used garlic naan bread, mild Italian sausage, and my homemade marinara sauce. I must say that the ricotta in the cheese base really does make this taste a bit like lasagna. The mozzarella on top did take a while to brown up, so I'll bump up the temperature to 400Â° next time. Quick and easy lunch today....and tasty, too! Delicious as pan Lasagna but so much easier on flat bread. Easy to make.  Easy add other favorite pizza toppings.  I want to cook it in my air fryer next time to compare it was amazing! turned out noice! Although you need more cheese and meat sauce to get the proportions right, it turned out pretty good! It ended up tasting like a flatbread meat lovers pizza and it was quick and easy to make! Awesome and easy! Subbed pepperoni for sausage and they were great! It was very delicious! I used garlic Naan bread. But plain would taste great as well. I made this Recipe, The taste was good Great review from my husband so this is definitely a recipe to keep! I used mild Italian sausage, ricotta cheese and Naan flatbread.  Most likely will make this for a luncheon or a dinner when hosting guests. My family enjoyed this recipe and I'm definitely going to be making it again. My marinara sauce was really bland, so I would recommend mincing up at least 3-4 cloves of garlic to give it a bit more flavour.
