This is a good recipe.... I made a few modifications - I used 16 dry-packed sun-dried tomatoes instead of oil-packed (soaked them in boiling water for 3-5 minutes and then coarsely chopped) and added a handful of toasted pine nuts (omitted red pepper flakes though). Very easy and tasty. I used half of a 270mL basil Classico pesto, if that helps anyone. :) Made it as the recipe  quick to make usually make tomato sauce based pasta this was a lovely change I followed the recipe and 3 out of 4 loved it.   I did add pine nuts, as another reviewer suggested, and the 4th person did not like them.   Will definitely make again! This dish has become family favourite. We all love it, and I make it once a week! And it is so quick to make as well, which great!  Can I use fish, such as salmon or Cod instead of chicken? I wait to hearing from you soon. Thank you üôèüèº Had a weird after taste. This was definitely easy to make and was pretty good as written.  It seemed a little bland so I added oregano to the chicken while cooking and more garlic.  I have an over-abundance of basil in my herb garden so I made my own pesto which put this over the top. It was pretty good though I would add more garlic.
