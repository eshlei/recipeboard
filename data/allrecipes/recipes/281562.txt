Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Evenly pierce entire pie crust with a fork. Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine pumpkin pie filling, evaporated milk, sugar, whiskey, eggs, salt, ginger, cloves, and cinnamon in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until just blended. Pour into the pre-baked pie crust. Return to the preheated oven and bake pie for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until filling is set and no longer jiggles, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature before serving, about 2 hours.
Tasted just like pumpkin pie with the cinnamon whiskey flavor at the end. Mine was done perfectly at the time stated. No problems. It set up as it cooled. AMAZING! Dwight approved :). This took 1 hr 28 minutes before the center was set. It was way too sweet. I used pumpkin pie filling as stated in the recipe. I should have used pumpkin puree since it calls for extra sugar, causing the over-sweetness. The flavor of the cinnamon whiskey was lost, sweetness being the only flavor detected. A hit! So easy to make!
