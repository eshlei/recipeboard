I made this yesterday and it was the talk of the party. EVERYONE loved it. I did not change a thing. One change - I did not layer it but mixed it all together and it was so beautiful, mixed together. The syrup was great too. There were about 70 people at the Picnic and people kept coming back for more. I made it bigger than called for and it still went faster than anything else. A definite keeper!!! Wish I could give it more stars. I acutally cut up everything the night before except the banana, and even made the sauce the night before too. Then a few hous before I served it I tossed it together, then cut and added the banana. YUMMY This Refreshing Cucumber Avocado Salad looks absolutely delightful! With the warm weather here, I’m always on the lookout for quick, healthy meals, and this recipe fits the bill perfectly. The combination of fresh cucumbers, creamy avocado, and zesty lemon is so appealing, and I love how you mentioned adding canned tuna for a protein boost—what a great idea!It's fantastic to hear how much your family enjoys this salad. It sounds like a hit at your dinner table! I can't wait to try it myself, especially with fresh ingredients from Simpli Namdhari's. They always have the best produce!Thanks for sharing such a simple yet flavorful recipe. I’ll definitely be making this soon! Simpli Namdhari's I made the recipe exactly as instructed. I did mix it all together rather than layering after pouring the sauce on it, but it was still beautiful and so delicious. I got rave reviews from some picky eaters. I will make this one again. This is my go-to fruit salad recipe.  I like it because it's so versatile.  You can switch up the fruit to whatever is in season.  I like the juice mixture because it gives the fruit a nice sweetness. Came out perfect! Substituted Honey crisp apples for the bananas. The wonderful sauce with its subtle yet distinct flavor really brings it all together.  Served for small family brunch along with scones & cream and egg casserole.  Everyone asked if there was any fruit salad to take home! :) Fabulous and easy to make!!! A friend brought this to our lunch today and I loved it!!!
