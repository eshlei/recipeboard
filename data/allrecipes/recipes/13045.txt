Mmmm, mmmm GOOD!!! I read all the reviews before making it and did a few "tweaks" to the recipe and I am blissfully happy with the results. Keeper recipe!Here are the "tweaks" that I made:I covered the broccoli with THREE cans of chicken broth instead of four. I used TWO bags (14 oz) of broccoli florets I used TWO lbs of Velveeta (actually I used the generic grocery brand, it was cheaper) Instead of mixing cornstarch with water, I mixed it with the FOURTH can of chicken broth.  Doubled the broccoli and added fresh cracked pepper. Topped with crumbled bacon...amazing! I made the recipe mostly as written; the only changes I made were to double the ingredient amounts and add some black pepper to taste before serving.  The results were outstanding.  Nothing melts as silky smoothly as good old Velveeta!  I love that you can throw this soup together quickly with inexpensive, readily available ingredients and come out with a delicious product you can proudly serve guests. It also reheats just fine. I made it a day before a tailgate party and then reheated it in a Crockpot on low.  It paired incredibly well with roast beef sliders. I saw a lot of dipping going on. This recipe is definitely a keeper. The only change I might make next time is to replace the garlic powder with chopped/mashed roasted garlic (to taste) and maybe replace a cup or two of the chicken stock with a cheap, dry white wine. It's not that this isn't already a great recipe; I like to experiment. I added a small shake of red pepper flakesI added just a hint of heatDELICIOUS! This recipe truly is what a broccoli cheese soup should taste like. It nails the flavor profile masterfully. The richness from the cheese and the freshness from the broccoli balance each other perfectly. Iâ€™d suggest enjoying this soup paired with a full bodied buttery chardonnay, what a great start to a dinner party ! It would also be heavenly with some garlic bread on the side. This was easy to make! I used heavy cream instead of milk and it was one of the best brocolli cheddar soups I have made! Perfect when followed. Doubled the BroccoliAdded 1/2 cup of steamed pureed AsparagusTopped with real bacon bits...yum We loved it.
