In a large bowl, mix the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, parsley, feta cheese, and olive oil. Chill at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before serving.
Very nice! Next time I might try Italian dressing instead of the olive oil. Thank you! My sister in law brought this salad over for a get together and she used red, orange, and yellow peppers.  And Kraft Three cheese dressing instead of the oil. It was delicious. Lovely, tasty, fresh.  I used 2 Tbsp EVOO and 1 TBSP balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp honey, pinch of salt, fresh ground black pepper, and some oregano.  Added a small amount of black olives for colour and flavour.  Really hit the spot! Awesome, however I did modify the recipe a smidgen I used good seasons Italian dressing instead of olive oil, I added tomatoes and black olives...my family loved it. Refreshing salad idea!  I added the balsamic vinegar suggested by Sarah Jo- great tip. I added a bit of avocado and tomatoes to the salad.  Everything else about the salad was the same except for the dressing.  I used the salad dressing from Greek Salad I Recipe here on allrecipes.  It was incredibly flavorful and really refreshing.  I would do again exactly the same way. Light, easy, delicious. I didn't have the yellow pepper, but it was fine with red, green, and cucumber. I thought the feta would be too much so I cut the amount by about 1/2...BIG MISTAKE! First thing requested was more feta, I used the advice of another cook and added a T or so of balsamic vinegar and it was fabulous! I will make this in a regular rotation of salad choices. This was a hit with everyone! I really loved this salad. If you like each of the ingredients individually, you'll like the way they taste together! I followed others' advice and added Italian dressing instead of olive oil, and omitted the parsley (because I didn't have any). So good.
