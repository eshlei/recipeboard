https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/282038/apple-crumble/
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pile sliced apples in an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Mix water and lemon juice together and sprinkle over apples. Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix well using an electric mixer. Add butter pieces and mix until mixture is crumbly; sprinkle evenly over apples. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly to thicken before serving in bowls. imee 
Excellent recipe. Super easy. I did add 2 more tablespoons of sugar. Have always loved apple crumble. Hubby said oh it won't be as good as the one we had in school. HA! He said it was better. I ended up making Apple Crumble pie with homemade crumbs on top. I put a ready made pie crust on the bottom of the pan, baked it for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Plied on the apples mixed with the dry crumble and baked it for 45 minutes. Put lots of crumbs on top and put it in the oven for 5 minutes so they stuck on the crumble. Yum, yum, yum. Now I just need to make whipped cream. Saving this recipe! Great easy tasty quick nice, goes with custard as well as ice cream as well as whipped cream. All year round recipe. Ridiculously easy and a great recipe. I would use an even smaller baking dish if I were to make it again as there was a lot of extra room. Topped with ice cream and it's a sweet treat. So warm, comforting and exquisite we had it for breakfast!The crumble topping was crunchy in texture and apple mixture was smooth, and both sweet and slightly tart.  This dessert, and for us breakfast too, was beyond enjoyable.My husband told me “It brings back childhood memories of mom’s apple crisp.”The additions I made were  to add a ¼ cup melted butter on top after the published baking time and broiled for 4 minutes.Also added a dollop of Reddi Wip topping for creaminess. So good 🤤 I've made it with apples, with pears, and with apples & pears together. It's super easy and quick to make and throw together and comes out so good every time. I add a little more lemon juice and skip the water, and usually add a little more sugar and cinnamon too. This recipe is great! This is so good! The crust gets crispy and caramelized on edges and apples get really tender. The only thing I might do differently is instead of dragging out my mixer I think my pastry dough cutter tool would work just as well, in fact probably quicker.  I can’t say enough about how good this is though. We put vanilla bean ice cream on top. Yum! Ding dang doo that'll do for me Super easy! Came out delicious 😋 It turned out beautiful the the grandkids loved it Excellent recipe.  Super easy. I did add 2 more tablespoons of sugar. Have always loved apple crumble.
