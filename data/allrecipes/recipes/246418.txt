Slow Cooker Irish Beef Stew
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246418/traditional-irish-stew/
Place potatoes, carrots, onion, and garlic into a slow cooker. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add beef; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to the slow cooker with vegetables. Pour 1/4 cup beer into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of beef off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in tomato paste; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into the slow cooker. Pour remaining beer, beef broth, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper into the slow cooker. Cook on Low until potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a fork, about 8 hours, or on High for 3 to 4 hours.
I added a package of Lipton onion soup mix halfway through the cooking time for additional flavor. I also let sit overnight and we had it the following day, which improved the flavor. In addition, I added 2 cupd of liquid, 1 water and 1 more of beef broth. We liked this stew a lot, and froze 1/2 of it for later. Next time I'll leave the tomato paste out of the recipe for a heartier flavor. Made as written and this was good. I recommend halving the carrot amount and cutting them in half. The full amount was too much for my liking and they were too hard to eat with a spoon whole. I added a package of Lipton onion soup mix halfway through the cooking time for additional flavor.

You can never use too much garlic. This easily adapts to a pressure cooker.
