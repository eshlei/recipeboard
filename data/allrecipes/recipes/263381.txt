Cajun Shrimp Pasta
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/263381/cajun-shrimp-pasta/
To form the roux, melt 1/3 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat until a pinch of flour sprinkled in the butter begins to bubble. Whisk in the flour to form a thick paste the consistency of cake frosting. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the flour turns peanut butter-brown, about 35 minutes. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add celery, onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Move half of the vegetables to a large saucepan. Pour roux into the small saucepan; heat over medium-low. Add diced tomatoes and green chiles, tomato paste, onion powder, garlic powder, white sugar, and cayenne pepper. Stir in tomato sauce and vegetable oil to the vegetable mixture in the large saucepan. Add roux mixture and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer; cook 10 minutes. Pour in 2 cups water; bring back to a simmer. Add shrimp and cook until pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in spaghetti, separating the strands. Cover and cook until spaghetti is tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper; garnish with parsley.
Upgrading my original review to four-stars with the following changes. Reduce flour in roux to 1/4 cup. Boil pasta separately. For the sauce, eliminate two of the cups of water, one of the cans of tomato sauce and the tomato paste.  Add 2 tsp. Cajun seasoning and 1/4 cup white wine. This was not a hard dish to make. I used fresh shrimp so most of my prep time was shelling and deveining the shrimp. I used fettuccini because I like a “meaty” pasta in dishes like this. I did add maybe 1 to 1 1/2  tsp of creole seasoning and I added andouille sausage. I cooked the sausage separately and then added it last and let it simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so. My husband loved it and it had just enough heat. If you like it spicy you might want to add more cayenne pepper.
