Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush flesh of butternut squash with olive oil and place cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until skin is wrinkled and flesh is soft, about 40 minutes. Scrape flesh into a bowl with a spoon and set aside. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add squash flesh, 2 cups hot broth, and ginger. Season with curry powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors are well combined, about 15 minutes. Purée soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add more hot broth for a thinner soup. Stir in cream and season to taste with sugar, cider vinegar, cayenne pepper, and more salt.
I added a couple medium carrots, otherwise changed nothing.  My main complaint is the tablespoon of sugar.  This is way too much.  My wife tasted it without seeing the recipe, and immediately said it was too sweet.  If you feel compelled, add a teaspoon max.  BTW, 3 inches ginger is a LOT.  Start out with less. Easy to make and very tasty. I'm not a ginger fan so I subbed garam masala for the ginger. My squash were massive so I used 4 cups each of the broth and whipping cream. I will make it again for sure. Delicious and easy to make!! The whole family liked it. I’ll definitely make it again. Very tasty! Will definitely make again!
