Maple Buttercream Frosting
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240463/maple-buttercream-frosting/
Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, and maple syrup with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated. Continue to beat until frosting reaches desired consistency.
This frosting is just like the description says, it is a very sweet frosting. A little goes a long way. I wouldn't suggest piping on cupcakes like I did. I think this would be good smeared on top of cinnamon rolls. Lovely maple flavored frosting to go with a homemade spice cake! I made half a recipe, and used about 2T of buttermilk instead of heavy cream. Such a nice surprise with the maple flavor! Tasty 10.09.16 ~ Yum, Yum, Yum - I could have eaten this frosting with a spoon, but I didn't, I only licked the beaters. I didn't have any whipping cream on hand, so I used a little milk. It worked perfectly and gave me the texture I wanted to frost 'Grandpop's Special Chocolate Cake' from AR. Definitely will be using this one again. I added a pinch of salt and used unsalted butter. It was perfect. Especially with chopped bacon!! The flavor is great, a bit sweet, but offsets the savory bacon flavor of the coconut I used. Next time less liquid. After the maple syrup, the consistency was fine and didn't need the cream. Nice and easy. I had actually put this together without looking on here first except that I used milk because I had no cream. Tis very sweet frosting and as it was intended for a spice cake I added a bit of cinnamon to this recipe and to my taste lessened the sweetness and improved the frosting for the spice cake.
