My Mango Lassi

Combine mangos, yogurt, milk, cream, confectioners' sugar, and cardamom in a blender; blend until smooth and frothy. Pour into glasses and serve immediately.
Delicious, refreshing and satisfying. Didn't have cardamom on hand and used just a drizzle of honey instead of icing sugar/confectioner's sugar... The fresh mangoes I used were sweet enough. Whatever you do, don't skip the heavy cream, and do refrigerate before lapping this treat up. I made a large batch that I indulged in over the course of two days. It kept well in the fridge! Yeah once you get expert in making normal lassi. I did not use the heavy cream nor sugar as my mangoes are sweet already... It was divine! I didn't have cardamon, but it was good! I loved having the chance to recreate the delicious mango lassis we had in India last summer.  I didn't have heavy cream so I threw in some mango nectar instead.  Wonderful recipe!  I might try it with heavy cream some day.  Thank you! Delicious, refreshing and satisfying.
