This is a great recipe. I use three chayote squashes and usually a box + a can of chicken broth (or sometimes I use 3 cans instead). I haven't used spinach before but baby bok choy or regular bok choy both make this delicious. I use a bit extra on the ginger and 1 large onion to make sure it's fragrant. No need for salt if you're using regular chicken broth. Easy, quick and wholesome! I love cooking from whole foods. All good except it was a bit salty and thatâ€™s without adding salt & pepper. I added 4 cups of water and then it tasted very good. I use diced chicken breast, extra ginger and fish sauce but otherwIse the same  itâ€™s our go  to  chicken soup. This was great and very easy to make! Thank you for sharing! I didnâ€™t peel the chayote & it was fine! I asked Alexa lol! Grew up in the PH and am a natural Filipino here. You can use rice wash instead of chicken broth. I will also stick with chayote, or papaya, or zucchini, and chili leaf replacements(moringa, spinach, bokchoy) as mentioned in the recipe, otherwise, the dish won't be called TINOLA. :D GREAT TASTE, EASY TO MAKE We like greens ðŸ¤­ First time I heard of Tinola was on a NYT podcast re: chicken soup.  We loved this recipe. I used spinach and chayote purchased from my H-E-B, and amped up the ginger and garlic.  They usually have Bok Choy but it was a busy Sunday.  I layered the baby spinach leaves on the bottom of the bowl with a scoop of  jasmine rice. Kept the spinach from taking over. Cynthia H. Perfect
