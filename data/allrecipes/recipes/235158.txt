Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather ingredients. Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze. Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve hot and enjoy! OTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
I don't normally go ga-ga over a recipe, even if I like it. I have to say, however, that these were the best pork chops I have ever eaten. I chose to bake the chops due to weather. My wife even told me to go online and give it five stars. No argument from me!! My family loved it there was nothing left! Only change I made was I used three tablespoons of honey. The chops were very moist, tender and juicy! My husband loved them too. I cooked mine on a Traeger grill so it took a bit longer to cook as it was a cool evening and it was a bit harder to keep the heat going. Will make these again! Make sure to marinade.Easy recipe! Made it in the oven, easy peasy I made these for my significant other and cooked them a little longer because she likes everything cremated. They came out really good and very tasty. I did it on my grill smoker using hickory. This is definitely a keeper. In fact we’re going to try the chicken too cause I’m sure it would come out great. No changes needed!
