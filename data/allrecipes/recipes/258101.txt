Cook turkey in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain. Transfer turkey to a slow cooker. Add tomatoes, lentils, pumpkin puree, pinto beans, pearl onions, green chile peppers, and garlic. Stir in water, brown sugar, chili powder, pumpkin pie spice, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Cover and cook on Low until flavors combine, 6 to 10 hours.
Delicious and easy. My only sub was red onion as I am not fan of pearl onions. Make this a day in advance if you can... flavors get better overnight in fridge. I make it this often and everyone loves it.  I use chopped onions instead of pearl onions.  It's gluten free, easy and delicious. We made this for Halloween, but we're not fans.  The taste is reminiscent of baked beans, and a good bit sweeter than we expect from chili.  It would probably be better with more tomato flavor. Delicious and easy.
