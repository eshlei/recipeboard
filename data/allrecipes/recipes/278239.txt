Bang Bang Shrimp Pasta
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/278239/bang-bang-shrimp-pasta/
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise, chili sauce, lime juice, and Sriracha together in a bowl. Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 more minute. Add cooked spaghetti and mayonnaise-chili sauce; toss to combine. Cook until sauce is hot, about 2 minutes. Turn heat off and let sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Divide among serving plates and garnish with chopped scallion.
I made the recipe as written. It’s a bit spicy but not excessively. I used thin spaghetti but linguine would be a better choice. Of course the shrimps make this dish. This is the first time, but won't be the last. I did follow the recipe and we really liked the flavor. A bit of sweet and spicy. I know it's a hot when my Filipino wife is asking for seconds. Will make again.Thank you Allrecipes.Bubba. ❤️😋😋 I used shell pasta instead of spaghetti pasta and added 2 dashes of Cajun spice. This was great!!! Definitely a keeper. No changes to recipe necessary. I made the recipe as written. It’s a bit spicy but not excessively. I used thin spaghetti but linguine would be a better choice. Of course the shrimps make this dish. Made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it I made it. Great taste. Thanks for tip!!
