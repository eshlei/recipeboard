This was really good and really fast! I didn't have any garlic powder so I put one minced garlic clove in with the marinade. Wonderful! I will make this again. Loved it for ease, simplicity and taste!  Only change was added two chopped garlic cloves to marinade vice dusting cooked steaks with garlic powder! Delicious. My husband really liked it and Iâ€™ll be making this again!! Looked up this recipe at the last minute and loved it! Very quick and easy. Even my kids liked it. I am a seasoned cook but I am intimidated by cooking fish on the grille. Came across this recipe while searching for how long to cook swordfish on the grille. I just happened to come across this recipe and the best part was I had all the ingredients on hand. I must admit I forgot to sprinkle the garlic powder on before serving but it was delicious none the less. Followed recipe exactly. Fish was moist and flavorful with really nice grille marks. This recipe is a keeper. Made this the night after I made the Tuna recipe From allrecipes. Straight forward, delicious, really enhances the Swordfish without distracting from the fish. No changes made. It was delicious & So Simple! I used teriyaki ginger marinade and sprinkled the garlic salt on top when complete. Easy to make and absolutely delicious! Grilled on gas barbeque. Loved it! This was so good! I will be making this again.
