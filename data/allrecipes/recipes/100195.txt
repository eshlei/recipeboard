Love this reciept. To prevent the soggy bottom I put the fish on a cooling wire rack and then set it in the baking dish,I also squeezed a little fresh lemon on it before it went in to the oven. it came out nice and crisp on both sides. My family loved it. Easy to fix and quite delicious. I'm not a fan of fish in general with the exception of haddock. This was by far the best baked haddock recipe I've ever had or made.  This will be my haddock recipe forever. So easy, quick and delicious! The recipe was ok.  It did lack flavor.  Haddock isn't a very flavorful fish so you need some yummy ingredients to give it a little more oomph.  I'd recommend a slice of tomato and some onion slices added about 5 minutes into the 10 minute baking process.  Adding some garlic powder or rubbing the fish with a sliced clove of garlic would help too. Just made this for dinner, and it tastes pretty good. Added some black pepper and Old Bay seasoning to the bread crumbs mixture; no other changes. Definitely a keeper. So easy and absolutely delicious . We loved this! I took some of the previous suggestions for adding pepper and garlic powder. This was easy and delicious! As good as any restaurant! So good!  So easy! This is a great baked Haddock recipe.  My family favorite and very easy to make. Yes use a lot less salt
