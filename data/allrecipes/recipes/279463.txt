Bring water, vinegar, and seafood seasoning to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add shrimp and stir. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam, stirring once or twice, until bright orange in color, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
My only change was to replace the water with a bottle of lager beer. Easy peasy & terrific! If you are steaming shrimp in a rice cooker and there are several layers, three to five minutes is not enough cooking time for all shrimp to turn pink. I use old bay and broil them on a sizzle plate with lemon or lime juice after having SLIGHTLY cooked with  boiled  water turned off , salt and pepper with FRESH parsley! Then over rice or just plain. Delicious!! This is NOT steamed shrimp, this is boiled shrimp.Nobody, except one, seems to notice?What the heck is the matter with you people? Not trying to be funny but this is boiling shrimp not steaming shrimp steaming shrimp you don't put them in the water they're in a steamer basket that's what steaming shrimp is just saying other than that good way to boil shrimp yes tasty WOW!!
