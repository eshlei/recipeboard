S'mores
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22146/smores/
Heat marshmallow over an open flame until it begins to brown and melt. Break graham cracker in half; sandwich chocolate between graham cracker and hot marshmallow. Allow marshmallow to cool a little before eating.
The s'mores were so good that my family and I couldn't get enough. However due to the weather I decided to just put them in the oven and they still came out great. I put the chocolate bars and marshmallows on top of the graham crackers on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven for about 2 mins. We took them out and then put another graham cracker on top and it was excellent. I like s'mores it was very yummy It's a classic - no frills - taste great recipe. Simple yet satisfying A fire is not practical for us, so we put a marshmallow on half of a graham cracker and microwave it until the marshmallow puffs up, then press the chocolate and remaining graham cracker half against the marshmallow.  We have also put peanut butter on the un-microwaved graham cracker half and omitted the chocolate, although you could probably use both peanut butter and the chocolate.  Good with chocolate graham crackers, too. I liked the sâ€™mores so much because they tasted so good.  I liked them  because they were chocolaty.  They were sticky so you should wash your hands.  I would make them forever. Try making them with chocolate covered shortbread or flavoured chocolate.  Yummmm I love s'mores and I eat them all the time during the summer when I have campfires at my lake.  They taste great with peanut butter or caramel sauce... My favorite variations. Classic! I love to experiment with differant candy bars.
