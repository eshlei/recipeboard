Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually add sugar and mix until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoon flour and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to batter and mix until batter is smooth. Peel and quarter apples. Remove core and cut apples like a fan from the outside towards the inside but do not cut all the way through. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a springform pan with butter. Spoon batter into the prepared springform pan and spread out evenly. Set cut apple quarters in a circle into the batter with the round, cut side facing up. Gently push apples into the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, allow to cool, and dust cooled cake with confectioners' sugar.
Very simple to follow. I made two 6” cakes with this recipe. The actual cake part is a bit more crumbly but a traditional cake like this is supposed to be. Hence the apples. I could easily add more apples but I enjoy the non apple bits with some cream or a bit of puréed berries. I will make this again. I read the earlier review that stated that this cake was too dry and crumbly, so I added 1/3 cup crushed pineapple and the juice (about a quarter cup) and it was delicious! Applesauce could also be added for a moister cake. I served this at my German Themed dinner party and it was a hit! This is a very different type of cake.  The crumb is coarse and rather dry.  I followed the directions precisely.  Not recommended. Delicious! Came out perfect! I used a 10-inch springform pan because I like to pack in as many apples as possible, and also added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
