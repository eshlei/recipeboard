Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add cloves and cardamom pods and wait until they sizzle, about 1 minute. Add onions and saut√© until dark brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Add chile peppers, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground chili pepper, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until blended in, about 1 minute more. Stir in chicken and water; cook, stirring constantly, until water is incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato puree and nutmeg. Cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Ladle into bowls and sprinkle garam masala over top. Garnish with cilantro.
Definitely make again and has definitely become a favorite. Pretty mild for me but easily spiced up with more chillies and curry powder.  You can halve the chicken and just use potatoes instead too. This recipe can be adapted as much as you like, e.g. add lime pickle, and doubled up for batch cooking and then frozen for another time.I blended the sauce for a smoother consistency but this is not required. This was delicious! A perfect balance of flavours. We've made this twice so far, and it is definitely on our 'favourites' list! Tasty and worth making; I would mince rather than crush the garlic. Definitely make again and has definitely become a favorite.
