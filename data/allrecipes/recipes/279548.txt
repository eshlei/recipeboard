https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/279548/dalgona-coffee-whipped-coffee/
Whisk boiling water, instant coffee, and sugar together until coffee is dissolved. Continue to whisk until mixture becomes thick and forms a peak, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour milk into a glass. Pour the frothy coffee on top of the milk.
Love this! It whips up amazingly creamy. I use skim milk and Splenda ( still whips fine) and then a little creamer I turned it into these frozen treats! They are really  good, and a refreshing pick-me-up on a hot summer day! Try it, if you love drinking dalgona coffee, youâ€™ll really love this version!(Will upload picture soon!) Delicious! I made as directed EXCEPT served it over hot coffee. I could not tolerate the idea of drinking milk. (Eww.) I make this all the time and i absolutely love it. I've top it up with whipped cream and I've even made it with vanilla ice cream instead of using milk and it tastes so good. I made my own per this recipe. It was missing something. Just iced milk at the bottom and some frothy sweet coffee at the top. The top was good, but the bottom was nothing. We only keep skim milk in the house, so maybe that was why, but I think the iced milk would have left something to be desired in any case. Very delicious!  This is a yummy frothy treat and Iâ€™m really enjoying it this morning.  As you can see in my photo, itâ€™s more than half gone. ðŸ˜‹ However, I would only make this on a rare occasion because the caffeine intensity level is really high for me. this is my favorite drink to make at home! its super good and the milk and coffee contrast so nicely. AWESOME!!!!!! Interesting to try the trend, and it tasted good, but I wouldnâ€™t make it again. I found it a little difficult to drink actually, like having a beer with too much head. A stand mixer makes a big difference in making the whipping step quick. great needs a little more sugar
