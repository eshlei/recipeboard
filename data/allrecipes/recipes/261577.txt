https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261577/cabbage-and-broccoli-slaw-with-vinegar-dressing/
Place cabbage, broccoli coleslaw mix, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Whisk vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a small bowl until combined. Pour over the coleslaw to coat; stir in scallions, cranberries, and almonds. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors meld, 8 hours to overnight.
I used rainbow slaw (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots & red cabbage).  I substituted cider vinegar for the rice vinegar and added about 1/2 tsp sugar to counter balance the tartness.  I toasted the sliced almonds.  I didn't add anything else.  We ate it soon after making it as there wasn't. time to let marinate longer.  My husband an I LOVE this recipe! This was a great low carb, low calorie option! It went well with my pulled pork tenderloin. I chopped cabbage and broccoli, instead of using the prepackaged. Subbed what I had on hand for some of the recipe items: Splenda for sugar, raisins for cranberries, and apple cider vinegar for rice vinegar. Also, roughly chopped raw almonds instead of using sliced and left out the grape tomatoes. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!
