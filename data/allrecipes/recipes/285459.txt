Place cabbage in a large bowl with cilantro, onion, and jalape√±o; toss to combine. Mix oil, lime juice, vinegar, salt, and sugar together in a small bowl. Pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Let sit on the counter for 1 to 2 hours, then drain. Serve at room temperature.
Made this last night for Taco Tuesday dinner and it was a hit. Our daughter even commented on much she liked the slaw. My husband was hesitant and said, "no mayo?" but he tried it anyway and said it was good. Will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I added about 1/2 cup mayonnaise, that helped, but I won't be making this again.
