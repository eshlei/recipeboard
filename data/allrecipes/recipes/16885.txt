Mom's Shepherd's Pie
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16885/moms-shepherds-pie/
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place potatoes and water to cover in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat; lower heat and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat; drain excess fat. Add tomato sauce, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, salt, ground black pepper, and green beans to the skillet. In a small bowl, mix water and flour together; stir into the skillet. Drain and mash potatoes. Spread potatoes over beef mixture. Poke 2 to 3 vent holes through top to release steam as casserole bakes. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Brush milk over potatoes and bake 5 minutes longer.
Delicious! Everyone in my family loved it. One note though...on the nutritional information, it gives the nutritional value based on 6 servings. This made much more than 6 servings! It fit in a 9x13 casserole pan, and served my family of 7 with lots of leftovers. I'd say it made 12 servings. So that means that the calories/fat etc. per serving would be much less. This recipe is really good! We have made this many times but I always top it with cheese and it is really good that way. corn not green beans Yum Less potatoes, added:   garlic, onion, cheese, Sage, Cumin & Oregano for MORE FLAVOR My family called this a keeper. Wasn't bad, but not as good as others. I believe I followed the recipes, but I did add salt and pepper and onion to the burger.  Just not very flavorful. Wasn't bad, but not as good as others.

A big hit will make it again this weekend?  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
