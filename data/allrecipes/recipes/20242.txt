The ingredients are correct in this recipe but it is missing a step that would solve the runniness problem. You must drain the yogurt in a colander for a few hours. This is the way they do it the Greek restaurants. You should also salt and drain the cucumbers for an hour. I tried this recipe and drained the yogurt first and it was great! This is very good. The flavor is just like the Greek restaurants.   I let the Greek yogurt drain through cheese cloth and a fine mesh strainer for a day or so until no liquid accumulated after emptying the bowl.  I like thick sauce and I have had an issue with this recipe ending up too runny even after draining the yogurt and squeezing the water out of the cucumbers.  I have read that English Cucumbers might work better because there is less water and fewer seeds.  Gonna try that next time. Delicious recipe! A little time consuming with the cutting, removing seeds and draining the cumbers but worth it. Did not have anything to drain the yogurt , just tipped the container over and drained as much as possible. It ended up being a little less thick , but still very good.Next time will try mixing by Hand instead of a using a food processor.Making kababs to go with the sauce. If you love a good Tzatziki sauce, save this one! Itâ€™s fresh and creamy and super easy to make. After following this recipe to a T(which turned out AMAZING!), I made it again, but sliced and salted the cucumbers, then let them drain overnight in a colander(over bowl), used a single clove of elephant garlic(makes peeling easier), and used a little extra dill for a slightly thinner sauce(more like a dressing for salad) that pops with flavor! Also, whole-fat Greek yogurt does wonders for this! Definitely will make again I was surprised by how well this recipe turned out.. I live pretty far north in Canada and fresh ingredients are hard to come by, so I used powdered garlic and dried dill. I have no idea how much juice is in half a lemon so I guessed at a tablespoon. I didn't strain the yogurt but I did add a bit of salt to the grated cucumber help pull the moisture out before I strained it.My only complaint would be to include measures for a tlbsp lemon juice and 3/4 cup of cucumber after being drained. Stuff like that. More experienced cooks can probably judge better than folks like me.This recipe makes a lot! And it's wonderful. Thank you! I used all of my energy to crush the cucumber through the strainer but it still came out watery.  Also, the flavor was just not that good.  Sad waste of ingredients.
