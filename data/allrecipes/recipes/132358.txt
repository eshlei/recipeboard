Easy Garlic-Lemon Scallops
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/132358/easy-garlic-lemon-scallops/
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook for a few seconds until fragrant. Arrange scallops in a single layer in the skillet; cook until golden brown on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn scallops over using tongs and continue cooking until firm and opaque, about 2 minutes more. Transfer scallops to a platter, reserving butter in the skillet. Whisk lemon juice, salt, and pepper into butter; pour sauce over scallops to serve.
I made some changes - first I infused some olive oil with garlic, I removed the garlic and seared the scallops in the oil on high heat. Once the scallops were done I transfered them to a plate. Then I added the butter and sauteed some garlic and shallots and added about 2 tablespoons of flour (as a thinkening agent for sauce). Then added some chicken stock and w-wine, lemon, pasta, asparagus, tomatoes, parmesan and of course the scallops and tossed it all together. So good!!! I guess I came up with my own recipe, but thanks for the good start.  Delicious!  Served with Angel hair pasta Aglio e Ogio.  Used leftover lemon sauce on the pasta too.  So yummy!  Thank you for sharing the recipe! Easy recipe. Used more minced garlic and less butter to get more seared taste. added more garlic perfect receipe and very easy amazing So delicious. Quick and easy. I will certainly be making this again. Simple recipe and very quick. T Substituted 1/4 of butter with toasted  sesame oil. Nice addition. Would cut salt in half the next time.
